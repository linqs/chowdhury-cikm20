Fake_1-Webpage,Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom,"335 SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical sex:”

Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.

He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.",http://occupydemocrats.com/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupy-democrats.jpg,['Colin Taylor'],http://occupydemocrats.com,{'$date': 1452628948000},[],"['http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/od-political-WEBSITE-SIDEBAR-SMALL.png', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupy-democrats.jpg', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/derp-1-340x150.jpg', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/LanaDelReyTrump-340x150.jpg', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/golfy-340x150.jpg', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/manafort-340x150.jpg', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupydemocrats-logo2x.png', 'http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/94cbb3560cca3d2e5338216af4b13172?s=164&d=mm&r=g', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/eric-1-340x150.jpg', 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumprussia-2-340x150.jpg']",http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/01/12/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/,"{'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og': {'site_name': 'Occupy Democrats', 'description': 'Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical…', 'title': ""Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom"", 'locale': 'en_US', 'image': {'width': 380, 'identifier': 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupy-democrats.jpg', 'height': 250}, 'url': 'http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/01/12/virginia-republican-wants-schools-to-check-childrens-genitals-before-using-bathroom/', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'image': 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/occupy-democrats.jpg', 'creator': '@ColsBols', 'description': 'Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their “anatomical…', 'card': 'summary', 'title': ""Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom""}, 'fb': {'admins': 100010978633754, 'app_id': 187891551586426}, 'msapplication-TileImage': 'http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/odfavicon-2.gif', 'article': {'section': 'Politics', 'tag': 'Virginia', 'published_time': '2016-01-12T16:02:28-04:00', 'author': 'http://facebook.com/ColsBols'}, 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1'}"
Fake_10-Webpage,PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT,"BREAKING!

Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.

They’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!

Scary!

From HuffPo:

A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.

In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.

At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.

The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.

The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.

Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.",http://usasnich.com/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president/,http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364.jpg,[],http://usasnich.com,{'$date': 1481479404000},[],"['http://usasnich.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/919-696x364.jpg', 'http://usasnich.com/wp-content/plugins/facebook-button-plugin/images/standard-facebook-ico.png']",http://usasnich.com/breaking-putin-interference-could-give-courts-legal-right-to-make-hillary-president/,"{'og': {'site_name': 'USA Snich', 'description': 'BREAKING!

Fake_100-Webpage,Barrels Removed From Clinton Property Contained Parts From 3 Missing Women – Freedum Junkshun,"Three women who all went missing in the mid-1970s have turned up, at least parts of them, in a steel industrial 55-gallon drum buried on the Clinton estate in Chappaqua, New York. The barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a “crude preservative.”

That means that whoever put them in there wanted to be able to visit them later. Investigators were hoping to find the torsos in the second barrel recovered but found nothing but women’s shoes inside, all brand new in boxes withy the tags still on them. One investigator called it “the weirdest thing he’s ever seen.”

The three women, all of whom were in their late teens or early 20s, were hitchhiking their way from California to New York in 1974 when they disappeared. Their last known location before heading back onto the road was a motel just outside of Little Rock.

Is it a coincidence that three pretty young girls who disappeared so long ago from Arkansas ended up dead and buried on a property in upstate New York? It does if you talk to the Clintons PR people:

“Bill and Hillary Clinton have nothing to do with this and welcome any investigation with open arms. They have offered the DOJ their full cooperation. You people and your conspiracy theories that everyone who dies in America must have had a run-in with Hillary or Bill Clinton need to sit down.”

Investigators say while they don’t yet have enough to charge Bill Clinton, they certainly have enough evidence to question him. When they approached the house to do their jobs, they were met by a team of lawyers and Secret Service personnel and told that unless they have some real evidence, Mr. Clinton was unavailable.

They added that he felt really bad for those girls but hoped at least now their families have closure. Clinton will use ignorance and the 5th amendment to once again try to get away with murder.",http://freedomcrossroads.us/breaking-barrels-removed-from-clinton-property-contained-parts-from-3-missing-women/,http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barrel.jpg,"['The Potatriot Is A Constitutional Conservative The Constitutional Republic Of The United States', 'About The Potatriot']",http://freedomcrossroads.us,{'$date': 1497990843000},[],"['http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wheaties-satire.jpg', 'http://i1.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Tomi-Lahren-CPAC-Hillary-Clinton-Elizabeth-Warren-Men.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'http://i0.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barrel.jpg?resize=678%2C381', 'http://i1.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barel.jpg?resize=80%2C60', 'http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barrel.jpg', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e4a67ab253be612c1eb6b4b4b69aea78?s=125&d=mm&r=g']",http://freedumjunkshun.com/breaking-barrels-removed-from-clinton-property-contained-parts-from-3-missing-women/,"{'description': 'Just how the hell is he supposed to explain this?', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.8', 'og': {'site_name': 'Freedum Junkshun', 'description': 'Just how the hell is he supposed to explain this? <a class=""mh-excerpt-more"" href=""http://freedumjunkshun.com/breaking-barrels-removed-from-clinton-property-contained-parts-from-3-missing-women/"" title=""BREAKING: Barrels Removed From Clinton Property Contained Parts From 3 Missing Women"">[READ MORE]</a>', 'title': 'BREAKING: Barrels Removed From Clinton Property Contained Parts From 3 Missing Women', 'url': 'http://freedumjunkshun.com/breaking-barrels-removed-from-clinton-property-contained-parts-from-3-missing-women/', 'image': {'width': 1200, 'identifier': 'http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barrel.jpg', 'height': 630}, 'updated_time': '2017-06-20T20:34:03+00:00', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'image': 'http://freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/barrel.jpg', 'description': 'Just how the hell is he supposed to explain this? <a class=""mh-excerpt-more"" href=""http://freedumjunkshun.com/breaking-barrels-removed-from-clinton-property-contained-parts-from-3-missing-women/"" title=""BREAKING: Barrels Removed From Clinton Property Contained Parts From 3 Missing Women"">[READ MORE]</a>', 'card': 'summary_large_image', 'title': 'BREAKING: Barrels Removed From Clinton Property Contained Parts From 3 Missing Women'}, 'msapplication-TileImage': 'http://i0.wp.com/freedumjunkshun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FJ-profile.jpg?fit=270%2C265', 'article': {'published_time': '2017-06-20T20:34:03+00:00', 'modified_time': '2017-06-20T20:34:03+00:00'}, 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'}"
Fake_101-Webpage,Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna,"On Monday, Bumble Bee Foods and 2 employees were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna. José Melena was performing maintenance in a 35 foot long oven at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant when coworkers loaded it with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and turned it on. Temperatures reached 270° during a two-hour process to cook and sterilize the tuna. The body of Melena,62, was found when the oven was opened.

The company, its plant operations director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require: implementing a safety plan; rules for workers entering confined spaces; and a procedure in place to keep machinery or equipment turned off if somebody is working in.

Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside and Florez, 42, of Whittier could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. “We remain devastated by the loss of her colleague José Melena in the tragic accident,” company said in a statement. “We disagree with and are disappointed by the charges filed by the Los Angeles Dist. Atty.’s office.”

According to the Associated Press, Florez refused to comment and messages seeking comment from Rodriguez were not immediately returned.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
Fake_102-Webpage,JUST IN TODAY Trey Gowdy Is The NEW DIRECTOR Of The FBI,"Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested in a Friday interview that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will be forced out at the top law enforcement agency as soon as next week.

Gowdy argued that newly released FBI records reveal political bias against President Donald Trump — and in favor of Hillary Clinton — at the highest levels of the FBI. Gowdy said that McCabe will likely be pushed out of the agency as a result of the perceived bias.

""I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week,"" Gowdy told Fox News of McCabe, adding that he would be ""shocked"" if McCabe testifies before the House next week.

The Washington Post reported last week that Gowdy settled a $150,000 veteran discrimination and retaliation claim from a former aide, who was fired in 2015 from the House Benghazi committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The aide alleged that he was wrongfully terminated in part for his unwillingness to engage in what he believed was a partisan investigation into Hillary Clinton's time as US secretary of state.


Attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators have escalated sharply in recent weeks, culminating in a partisan haranguing of the FBI director last week over the perceived missteps of his predecessor.

Conservative and far-right media outlets, already skeptical of Mueller's probe into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia, grew louder in their calls for FBI Director Chris Wray to either clean house or for Mueller to resign. It came after news that two special counsel investigators at one point exhibited perceived political bias.

Trump again characterized the criminal justice system as ""rigged"" during a rally in Florida on Friday, echoing comments he made last weekend following former national security Michael Flynn's guilty plea as part of Mueller's probe.

President Donald Trump lamented the state of the FBI, the nation's top law-enforcement agency, shortly before delivering a speech at an FBI graduation ceremony on Friday in Quantico, Virginia.

""It's a shame what's happened with the FBI, but we're going to rebuild the FBI. It'll be bigger and better than ever,"" Trump told reporters before boarding Virginia-bound Marine One on Friday morning.


The president also recently described the country's top law-enforcement agency as ""in tatters,"" but a White House spokesman said on Friday that Trump had ""full faith and confidence"" in the rank-and-file members of the Department of Justice and the FBI.

Also on Friday morning, Hogan Gidley, the White House's deputy press secretary, said that recently released FBI records showed ""extreme bias"" against Trump among leadership at the FBI.

Recently disclosed text messages between two FBI agents assigned to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign included a reference to Trump as an ""idiot."" Both agents are no longer involved in the Russia investigation. Other records revealed edits made to soften the statement of James Comey, then the FBI director, concerning the agency's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

Gidley called the records ""eye-opening"" and ""deeply troubling.""

""There is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time,"" Gidley told ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday morning.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
Fake_103-Webpage,BREAKING: Johnny Depp Taken Into Custody By Secret Service,"Johnny Depp made a big mistake when he threatened to assassinate President Trump. His little stand-up routine, that wasn’t funny, has now landed him in the back of a black SUV on the way to a federal holding facility for questioning.

Special Agent Bob Argueta was barking orders at other people at the scene before we enticed him with jerky to give us a statement. Skip Tetheluda, whose jerky has landed more than a few exclusive interviews, says Argueta was told to take Depp deep and dark into the night, make sure they weren’t followed and bring him for advanced interrogation. He responded to allegations that this takes a joke by an actor way too far:

“People just assume he was kidding. What they don’t know is that Depp actually had maps and timetables and plans to assassinate President Trump if he ever visited Concord, New Hampshire again, which he certainly would during the 2020 general election season.

Depp is a dangerous criminal. Some of the content on his computer indicate he may have been radicalized while he was studying in Muslim waters for his Captain Jack Sparrow role.”

There you have it. If they found out Depp was a Muslim convert with plans to kill the President he may never see the light of day again. It’s difficult to think of our favorite actors as such horrible people sometimes, but Hollywood is just filled with tree-hugging, self-righteous, Prius driving freaks.

Fake_104-Webpage,State Of Minnesota Has Just Handed Over FULL CONTROL To Muslims So They Can Take Down ‘Infidels’,"There is not a day that goes by that we don’t hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasn’t stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.

Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.

According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported:

The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.

The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday.

The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.

“Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.”

The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website.

The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: “I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.” The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands. This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany’s approach in the 1930’s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

Fake_106-Webpage,Paul Ryan: “Donald Trump Plans To Resign From Office Within The Next 30 Days”,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days.

“Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,” Ryan told reporters. “Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.”

News of this comes as Russia’s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.

“If the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,” Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. “Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.”

Donald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.

“We did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you’ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!”

“We think this is the best thing,” Ryan continued. “He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it’s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.”

After word spread of Trump’s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.

“I think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he’s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.”

Lloyd Glacier, a spokesman for ‘Sock It Forward‘, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump’s plan to resign.

“This will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.”

38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.

“When I’m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,” Horner said. “Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it’s all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased. Just an FYI, you’re all going to burn in Hell for eternity, but Jesus loves you very much! Praise Fappy!”

The Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments about Trump’s impending resignation. That hotline’s phone number is (785)

Fake_107-Webpage,Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public,"Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public

Australia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public. NBC news predicted that all Americans would be microchipped by 2017, but it seems Australia may have already beaten them to it. Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system.

Now, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it.

Under the headline ‘Australians embracing super-human microchip technology’, Australia’s premier media outlet news.com.au (News Corp Australia) reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand.

Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.

She told news.com.au:

“You could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs it’s the same technology as Paypass, so I’m hoping you’ll be able to pay for things with it.”

“With Opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. Any door with a swipe card … it could open your computer, photocopier. Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.”

The microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. In her interview with the Australian news outlet, Shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle:

“My nana wants one. I’ve had more opposition to my tattoos than I’ve ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.”

In fact, the 27-year-old has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens where for just $80 to $140, people can become so called “super humans.” On the same day this news story broke, Shanti appeared at Austarlia’s launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided, alongside American implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra.

As you can see, the push for RFID microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology, is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become “super human,” but clearly if you become part machine/computer, that means there will be someone who can control that technology. If you think the elites wouldn’t capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously don’t know history very well.

Amal Graafstra, who became one of the world first RFID implantees back in 2005, just made headlines recently in the US with a prototype of the world’s first implant-activated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology.

He’s written a book, spoken at TEDx and also appeared in a number of documentaries.

In an interview with the Australian media outlet, Amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has “given me the ability to communicate with machines. It’s literally integrated into who I am.”

Shanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today, which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe.

Ever since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all weren’t living as ‘super-humans’.

Fake_108-Webpage,“Trump Has The Legal Right To Cancel SCOTUS Because They Serve At His Pleasure”,"During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.”

Asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.”

Spicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.”

“This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,” Spicer concluded./politicops.com

Fake_109-Webpage,The Democrat James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With Was JUST REVEALED! (DETAILS) – Freedum Junkshun,"As we promised, Freedom Crossroads has just learned the identity of the Democrat James Comey has been having an affair with for at LEAST the last 8 months, it’s none other than the DISGRACED former Chair of the DNC, Debbie “Whiny Democrat” Wasserman Schultz — talk about a match made in Heave… errrrr… Hell!

These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can’t accept defeat, but that doesn’t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?

BREAKING: James Comey’s Affair Interfered With The Clinton Investigation

According to our exclusive sources, Comey and Wasserman Schultz met while both working for the government, and despite the fact that both of them are married, they couldn’t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they’re two liberal sickos — and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them.

And now we all know the REAL reason that the sad ex-FBI Director Comey is trying to attack Donald Trump… to impress his GIRLFRIEND!

Pathetic.

The staff at Freedom Crossroads is working diligently around the clock to bring you more details about the newest salacious tryst. Stay tuned!

Fake_11-Webpage,War on Christmas Obama orders ban on Christmas cards to military,"Obama’s military command will prevent delivery of Christmas cards being sent from families to their servicemen loved ones overseas spokesmen for The Pentagon said today. The White House claims that traditional Christmas greetings wish will upset Muslims in host countries and will have to convicted and returned to the sender.

Per executive order,all overseas military mail will be monitored for references to Christmas, Jesus Christ, or pork products which are known to offend Muslims.

An Army Veteran who reached out to Fox News said Pentagon leadership is “hypersensitive to anyone who says they feel like their rights are being violated.”

“It’s extremely frustrating,” the soldier said. “The U.S. Military is living in fear of radical Muslims.”

The soldier, who asked not to be identified because he feared being disciplined or assaulted my Muslims, said many people are furious over the censorship

.

“If soldiers cannot speak the name of God, let alone Christ, what are we fighting for?” he asked. “I’ve towed the company line for years but this has pushed me too far to sit quietly while personal liberties are trampled upon.”

The soldier said in recent months they have been reminded that they cannot proselytize and they cannot share their faith say anything nice about Jesus or Christianity.

“We are strongly discouraged from having any kind of Christian items on our desks or in our offices,” he said

Texas-based Liberty Institute sent a demand letter to the White House, insisting they immediately drop this policy which allows a generic greeting but disallows references to Christmas, which is officially recognized as a national holiday under federal law.

Liberty Institute’s Director of Litigation, Hyman Stratcher, responded in a statement, “Obama is once again engaging in unlawful religious discrimination. It is shameful that the military continues to censor religious speech in Christmas cards while allowing atheists,gays, and satanists to send porn,drugs,electronic cigarettes,or any other ungodly thing they want.”

Imam Al-Suq Akweer of the Islamic Friendship Coalition applauded the move as a step in the right direction in the quest for improved Islamic relations.

“Disbelievers are trying to draw Muslims away from the straight path”.he said,”Christmas Day and associated celebrations are among the ”falsehoods” for a Muslim to avoid.A Muslim is neither allowed to celebrate the Christmas Day nor is he allowed to congratulate them.Americans on Muslim soil must learn to abide by our customs to ensure peaceful relations.

The ban will go into effect December 15th.Military personnel will be given handbooks to explain what can and cannot be sent from home.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
Fake_110-Webpage,“White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery”,"On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has “sanctioned” violence, as long it protects the “people favorable to the Obama position, politically.” She insisted that the president is sending “a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don’t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.” She also linked the Obama administration’s “lawlessness” to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving “normal” people helpless in the face of anarchy.

“And these days it has become so obvious that I’m honestly surprised we’re not having riots throughout the country,” she said. “When did this become a nation of criminals? I didn’t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I’m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.”

The ex-Rep. then argued that “not even slaves” suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. “It’s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I’m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear – we’re supposed to be all evolved right now, we’re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He’s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you’ve seen in Minneapolis.”

“In fact,” Bachmann continued firing, “I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama’s presidency.” She added, “Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does.”

“And let’s get one thing straight – I’m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I’d be saying the same thing all over again,” Bachmann quipped. “That’s what I’m trying to point out – white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I’m seriously worried whether or not we’ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we’re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we’ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another – white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that’s just one step away from extinction,” Bachmann concluded./politicot.com

Fake_111-Webpage,"Paul Ryan: “22 Million Americans Choose To Be Poor, So It’s Their Own Problem If They Can’t Afford To Be Healthy”","House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the Republican health care plan. During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate’s version of the health care bill is signed into law. “What they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you’re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want, then they won’t buy it,” the Speaker opined. “So, it’s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it’s that people will choose not to buy something that they don’t like or want.”

Kilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is “a choice.” “This is something we’ve been over on more than once occasion,” Ryan said. “I know why you’re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I’m sorry Brian, but it’s not working. And the reason why it’s not working is, you’re using the wrong logic here. You’re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That’s not right.”

“Why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don’t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?” Ryan opined. “The answer is – they shouldn’t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that’s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that’s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you’re doomed.”

“Being rich or poor is a matter of choice; that’s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they’re going to be healthy?

Think of the message we’d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people.

Fake_112-Webpage,Obama Goes To G20 Summit,"62.1k SHARES Share

Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?

“The funny thing,” a White House official said, “is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.”

“But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,” he went on, “no one in the press would say it was her staffs’ fault.”

That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

Fake_113-Webpage,CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women – TEO info,"Fareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ a program focusing on international events, has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.

Zakaria’s blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.

“The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.

Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”

The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.

CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee, stating that there was no evidence of hate speech or racism in Zakaria’s writings because he only targeted whites and not minorities. “Some people are just being too sensitive,” a CNN representative said in defense of Zakaria, adding that “someone’s hurt feelings should not inhibit our right to free speech.”

“Every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,” Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.

While many have indeed expressed emotional pain and fear after reading his controversial statements, no apology has been heard from Zakaria or CNN at the time of this writing.

Fake_114-Webpage,White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months – The Halfway Post,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.

Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.

“It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”

Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.

“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”

Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.

“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”

No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.

Fake_116-Webpage,"""The 2nd Amendment Was Written Before Guns Were Invented""","Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency.

She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”

Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”

Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”

“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”

Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”

“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.

Fake_117-Webpage,A Hollywood Star Is Moving To Canada Because Of President Trump,"Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections. Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise. However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger.

TRUMP “HAD ”TO DO HEALTHCARE FIRST,BECAUSE HE NEEDED 1 TRILLION HE STOLE FROM POOR, SICK,& DYING,2 GIVE TAX CUTS TO TOP 2%

— Cher (@cher) May 5, 2017

Cher is one of the many leftist famous people who constantly attack President Donald Trump. A lot of those stars have attempted to fit in the world of politics in order to defend themselves , but in most of the cases, they had no significant success, but rather ended up making a fool out of themselves.

During the presidential race, a lot of them promised to leave the country if Trump was elected, but not a single one of them stuck to the promised.

All they want to achieve is make everyone share the same opinions they do, which is pretty contradictory to their liberal beliefs that everyone has the right of personal opinion, different than the others. On the other hand, the conservative ideology is still widely present across the USA, which makes things even more difficult for them.

Apparently, it would have been way better if they all simply moved to Canada. Now, they forgot what their real job is, and they take every chance to bash our President. Americans are beginning to feel nervous about and dislike it.",http://conservativearmy88.com/breaking-hollywood-star-moving-canada-president-trump/,http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_6-9.png,[],http://conservativearmy88.com,{'$date': 1500057441000},[],"['http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_44.jpg', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_43.jpg', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_1-26-390x205.png', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_6-9.png', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_1-26.png', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_5-13-130x90.png', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_43-130x90.jpg', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_44-130x90.jpg', 'http://conservativearmy88.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot_5-13.png']",http://conservativearmy88.com/breaking-hollywood-star-moving-canada-president-trump/,"{'description': 'Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections.

Fake_118-Webpage,Russian Mansions Obama Seized Were Meant To Be Illegal Gifts To Sasha And Malia – News Feed Hunter,"Well, well, well…it looks like Obummer wasn’t actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since there’s nothing to punish them FOR) — he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards.

After a breaking story about the scandal hit Russian news, multiple sources have confirmed the story. The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.

But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer’s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.

Once again, we’re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won’t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER.

Fake_119-Webpage,"Barack Obama Tweets SICK Attack On John McCain, Says He Should Have Died","Barack Obama is a sick human being unfit for any political office past, present, or future. Just like ultra left-wing Bernie Sanders supporter Caitlin Johnstone, Obama (Barry Soetoro as he was known in college while he was doing sexual favors for old men to get cocaine money) attacked a recovering John McCain viciously Wednesday night then deleted the tweet like a coward.

“John McCain is NOT a war hero,” our Muslim former “President” said, adding that “if there were any god in heaven” the Senator would have died from his brain tumor.

Obama had previously tweeted out wellwishings at 8:49 p.m. and apparently accidentally sent his REAL feelings (seemingly intended for a private message) which he quickly hid from the world.

The tweet was deleted within two minutes but was already shared by more than 73,000 liberals who want nothing more than to see someone who has served our country die in agony.He even brought God’s name into it.

Obama has repeatedly attacked our servicemen for more than eight years, doing more damage to them than ISIS and al Qaeda combined according to a study done by the Freedom Coalition for Conservative Values

You have to realize that liberals like Obama pledged themselves to Satan long ago and are nothing but a bunch of idiot lowlifes.

Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted his thoughts and prayers to McCain because they are Christians who love everyone even if they have had their differences in the past:

Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. pic.twitter.com/SO4XYgnyug — President Trump (@POTUS) July 20, 2017

It’s up to us to stand with our CHRISTIAN President Trump and oppose the liberal hatred, to continue fighting to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

Fake_120-Webpage,Wasserman Schultz Going To Mental Hospital After What She Did Overnight Desperate To Escape Arrest,"The biggest story this week was the arrest of Pakistani Muslim and longtime aide of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan. Earlier this year, Awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen. Shortly, after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and Imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time. In his attempt to avoid facing justice, Awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport. This, of course, is scandalous, to say the least, and it was turned up another few notches after Imran hired his lawyer. The lawyer that was hired to defend Imran was no other but a close Clinton family associate and lawyer Chris Gowen.

Here is more from Conservative Review:

In 2012, Gowen went to bat for Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, whose family is deeply connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. After GOP reps explored Abedin’s nefarious ties, Gowen pledged to “stand with Huma.”

Along with his private practice, the longtime Clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at American University Washington College of Law, where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management.

Gowen’s Clinton connections are intriguing on another level, given that Awan’s employer in the House, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, remains a close Clinton confidant. The former Democratic National Committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the Democratic primary in Clinton’s favor. Wasserman Schultz was also the 2008 campaign co-chair of Hillary Clinton’s first failed run for president.

Reading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non-stop, but that has not occurred at all. In fact, ABC, NBC, and CBS have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal. Of course, that seems ludicrous, but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all. However, that has not stopped Americans from pressing for more information, and the heat is getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Now, they are reports that Debbie is not fairing well, and has been an absolute wreck since Imran’s arrest. Also, there are calls for Debbie to testify before Congress growing louder, and it seems that she is about to cave.

Here is more from Conservative Fighters:

Debbie Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cyber-security breach.

Imran Awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the U.S. after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan. Fox News is the only cable network covering this huge scandal. When Imran Awan was arrested he was carrying $12,000 in cash on him. His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash when she fled the country too.

Imran and his Muslim brothers, Abid and Jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as IT specialists. The three brothers were making $161,000, $165,000, and $160,000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background.

Word has it that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is an absolute wreck since Imran Awan was arrested. Calls for her to testify to Congress are increasingly growing as well.

Wasserman Schultz knows she’s in hot water over this IT scandal. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the FBI seized smashed hard drives belonging to Imran Awan. We also reported that Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police with ‘consequences’ for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a Pakistani IT staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches.

It is rather clear in watching the video that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has something to hide. Since, why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the Clinton’s?

John Cardillo reports, ‘Florida politicos who have known Wasserman Schultz for years are telling me she’s a nervous wreck, barely able to function since Imran Awan’s arrest.

FL politicos who have known @DWStweets for years are telling me she's a nervous wreck, barely able to function, since #ImranAwan's arrest. — John Cardillo (@johncardillo) July 27, 2017

Then someone witnessed Wasserman Schultz in the midst of an epic meltdown in public. Is it possible that Wasserman Schultz is realzing that the DNC is crumbling all around her now?

This is why alternative news is exploding over the traditional sources of media. The mainstream media is refusing to cover this story but will report the fake Russian collusion story, and President Trump’s ban on transgenders in the military. They will do anything they can to stop the real truth of what is happening in our government to be revealed.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz holds the key to many answers that the American people deserve to know. Hopefully, by keeping the pressure on Wasserman Schultz she will crack and we can get to the bottom of the DNC corruption once and for all.

The 47-year-old man, who leaves behind his wife and six children, took his own life to avoid voting for Donald Trump during the Electoral College that will swear the next president-elect this week.

A letter he wrote before taking his own life explains the reasons for his apparent suicide.

“ I do not want to carry the burden of Trump’s election on my shoulders, so for the greater good of my children and future generations, I am doing what I believe is best for my country and I hope others will follow in my footsteps ” – Jeremy Hashville

A tragic end

According to the Detroit City Coroner’s report, the last moments of Mr. Hashville would have been “excruciating painful”.

“The deceased would have first attempted to take his life by swallowing 36 laxative tablets that he possibly mistook for antidepressants” describes the 236 pages report.

“Despite intolerable intestinal pain, the man then threw himself in front of a bus after literally throwing himself from the balcony of his apartment on the sixth floor but would have miraculously survived,” commented James Arnold of the Detroit Police.

“The deceased would have finally covered his own body with gasoline before succumbing to his injuries after lighting himself on fire by inserting his head into the family microwave,” he concluded about the tragic death.

Jeremy Hashville was a member of an anti-Trump movement trying to convince 37 major voters of the Grand Old Party to abandon their candidate, forcing the US House of Representatives to choose a new president among the Republicans.",http://universepolitics.com/2016/12/19/electoral-college-elector-commits-suicide-to-avoid-voting-for-donald-trump/,http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/police.jpg,[],http://universepolitics.com,{'$date': 1482105600000},[],"['http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ggtt.png', 'http://i2.wp.com/worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/elector.jpg?resize=600%2C315', 'http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/freedom-caucus-members-affordable-care-act-277x190.jpg', 'http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/police.jpg', 'http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/aaron-schock-replacement-election.jpeg4-620x412-277x190.jpg', 'http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/download-3-277x190.jpg']",http://universepolitics.com/2016/12/19/electoral-college-elector-commits-suicide-to-avoid-voting-for-donald-trump/,"{'ca_image': 'http://universepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/police-150x150.jpg', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.7.5', 'og': {'site_name': 'Universe Politics', 'description': 'Detroit, MI | A Michigan elector, in a surge of despair at the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency, has\xa0taken his life late last night.

Fake_15-Webpage,“Koran And Holy Bible Are The Same”,"On Monday the Bishop Of Rome addressed Catholic followers regarding the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the Vatican’s guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible.

“Jesus Christ, Mohammed, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths.

This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by.

We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.”

Fake_16-Webpage,"Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies. Be careful with this, moms!","It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub. It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.

But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.

A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.

When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.

She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.

She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.

She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.

The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.

She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.

The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.

The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.

Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.

We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.",http://smag31.com/mom-applies-remedy-baby-moments-later-dies-careful-moms/,http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzE0ZjcyY2FhZjJmOTA4NTczMzYyYWU4ZWUzOTQ1OTgyLmpwZw.prx_.ca7c6ddb.jpg,[],http://smag31.com,{'$date': 1480092005000},[],"['http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sunscreen-360x180.png', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15337384_1222194804534148_9030918027401594581_n-150x150.png', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzc5ODdlM2I5NWMyYzJhNDQxM2MxMDZkMDY3MTU5OTIwLmpwZw.prx_.4c5e33ae.jpg', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/love-1111816_1280-150x150.jpg', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzE0ZjcyY2FhZjJmOTA4NTczMzYyYWU4ZWUzOTQ1OTgyLmpwZw.prx_.ca7c6ddb.jpg', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/15337384_1222194804534148_9030918027401594581_n.png', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kqf4hj0clwi-seth-doyle-150x150.jpg', 'http://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/smag31.png']",http://smag31.com/mom-applies-remedy-baby-moments-later-dies-careful-moms/,"{'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og': {'site_name': 'Smag31', 'description': 'It might be hard to believe, after all, many of us had used Vick VapoRub.

Fake_17-Webpage,"Bill Murray Had This to Say About Rochester, New Hampshire Residents – News Daily 12","ROCHESTER, New Hampshire – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Bill Murray took a moment to praise Rochester, New Hampshire residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Rochester, New Hampshire when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, “Sure, what the hell.” So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester – some place called Wild Willy’s – and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire, ” Murray said with a laugh.

Murray added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Rochester. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

This amount of corruption is a next level thing that we haven’t seen portrayed this nonchalantly before. Namely, Michelle Obama’s mom failed to earn a pension that’s three times the amount of an average American family’s whole income!

It appears to be that just as Barack, the rest of the Obama’s never intended on getting jobs as us, the regular folks, because they got the chance to live on the backs of honest and hard working Americans that pay taxes.

Congress just announced the most stupid, unexplained and unethical waste of taxpayer money prepared by no other than Obama.

First Grandma Marian Robinson, 79, will get a big fat check for a lifetime worth 160K government pension when she takes off the White House next year, as concluded by congressional budget statements.
As concluded in documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mrs. Robinson got to be eligible for the lifetime pension for “services rendered as full-time/in-home caregiver” for granddaughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, during President Obama’s eight years in office.

Michelle Obama’s mom got to live better than a royalty in the White House, but they are still going to privilege her with $160,000 every year for the rest of her life just for being there her own granddaughters?

Fake_19-Webpage,Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President – USA Radio,"WASHINGTON — The President-elect of the United States, Donald Trump has on Wednesday issued a warning to the outgoing President of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama.

Talking to the NY Times, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa’s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country’s elections.

The praise was followed by a warning.

“As an outgoing President, you don’t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming President. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately” – Trump warned.

Trump went on further to describe the actions of the outgoing president as that of a ‘lizard’s shit’. “Don’t end your beautiful shit with a different color.” – he added.

Trump’s warning comes days after the outgoing president of Ghana increased allowances of its National Service Scheme personnel and also offered jobs to some people.

“We need more and more jobs. Unemployment is way up here,” he said. “He’s hired more employees, more people, than anyone I know in the world.”

I believe in him first of all because he’s a businessman. I think jobs are badly needed.

Hollywood star, Denzel Washington is usually catching some heat through supporters of President Obama after calling his agenda “anti-Christian.

” Washington talked out about his own Christian beliefs during the 1999 interview. During the interview, he shared his story of how he or she uncovered religion.

As the particular son of a preacher and spending a majority of his time in the church, he grew to become rebellious as a teen. After what Washington calls a personal face along with God, he came back in order to the church in his 20s. “I had this particular tremendous physical and spiritual experience. ”

His devotion to his faith has shocked liberal Hollywood plus angered President Obama supporters who support his alleged “anti-Christian agenda. ” As other celebrities live a liberal and free life-style, Washington has explained that he is proud of his religion.

Fake_20-Webpage,Confirmed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is RESIGNING From The Post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,"If this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump.

She said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.

The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought.

“I DON’T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS,” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT’S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE.

“I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE’S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE,” SHE ADDED.

“DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS, I DON’T RECALL HIM EVER MAKING THE RIGHT ONE, AND THAT’S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THIS COUNTRY.”

AFTER OPENING FIRE AT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, GINSBERG TURNED TO HER OWNwi PLANS SHOULD DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY BECOME THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

“THERE’S NO NEED TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, SO I’M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT – I WILL RESIGN MY POSITION AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THAT HAPPENS. I CANNOT IMAGINE PERFORMING MY DUTIES UNDER THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT EVERY RULING WE AS AN INSTITUTION MAKE WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. I CAN TOLERATE THIS CHARADE OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT I COULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM AS PRESIDENT,” SHE SAID.

“I AM A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED LONG ENOUGH, AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I’VE HAD A PROSPEROUS AND FULFILLED LIFE,” JUSTICE GINSBERG ARGUED.

However, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when I’m aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
Fake_21-Webpage,Meryl Streep Just Got Fired From A Major Project For Lying About Trump – Americas Last Line of Defense,"Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 56.9k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER

After saying 6 minutes of mean things about Donald Trump without ever once using his name, humiliating him in front of a crowd of Hollywood elites and millions watching around the world, Meryl Streep got word From Ron Howard that she was no longer being cast as an older, wiser version of Mrs. C in a reboot of Happy Days that was to make her millions.

Streep was to team up with Otis Winslow of “Family Matters” so Happy Days could be written into this century, with multi-racial families, gender identity and the gays playing a role in the plotlines. Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn’t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff. Scot Baio had to be ejected from auditions when he found out he didn’t get the part.

Now the project is on hold as the other person cast perfectly for the role was Florence Henderson, who passed away recently, but producers are hoping to fill the gap with Deborah from Everybody Loves Raymond.

Meryl Streep, who hasn’t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes, is said to be almost broke and that the millions from this project were to basically cover her retirement. The date for that has been moved up now that she’s been deemed overrated by Trump and irrelevant to most Trump supporters, which basically covers the known world and the leader of it.

Fake_22-Webpage,Mike Pence: “Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped”,"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.

Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that “abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.” “So, let’s get that straight right away – I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn’t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we’re murderers of innocent beings who can’t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?” the Indiana governor said.

“And as if that wasn’t enough,” Pence continued, “we’ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that’s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost – we can’t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let’s be clear. And that’s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I’m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.”

Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”

Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher’s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I’m not a murderer.”

“And it gets worse – when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.",http://politicot.com/mike-pence-allowing-rape-victims-abortions-will-lead-women-trying-get-raped/,http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o.jpg,['Alex Stevan'],http://politicot.com,{'$date': 1468778303000},[],"['http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dakota_Meyer_with_President_Obama-150x150.jpg', 'http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thousands_protest_against_anti_gay_Charles-Worley-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o-645x325.jpg', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/130729170454-lead-intv-ted-cruz-full-00060416-story-top-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Michael-Folk-1.jpg', 'http://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o.jpg', 'http://politicot.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg']",http://politicot.com/mike-pence-allowing-rape-victims-abortions-will-lead-women-trying-get-raped/,"{'description': 'satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.8', 'og': {'site_name': 'Newslo', 'description': 'The Republican war on women continues unabated.

Fake_23-Webpage,Barrack Obama will be on new 1 dollar bill 2017,"The White House has approved the redesign of U.S. currency.  Barack Obama will be on the new dollar bill.

The Obama Administration feels that the American dollar is in bad need of a makeover.  They have partnered with the Dollar ReDe$ign Project to pick a new design for U.S. currency.  Currently, the design that the administration likes best was done by Dowling Duncan (a British duo), which features a unique vertical design.  It also features President Obama on the one dollar bill.

“We love the Dowling Duncan look.  They’ve come up with a creative design and put President Obama where he belongs… on number 1,” said David Axelrod, Senior Adviser to President Obama.



The Dollar Redesign Project was organized by creative strategy consultant Richard Smith.  He is still soliciting ideas for the dollar bill of the future. “Our great ‘rival’, the Euro, looks so spanky in comparison it seems the only clear way to revive this global recession is to rebrand and redesign,” the project notes on its website.

Here’s the web site for  The Dollar Redesign Project.

“Don’t waste your time submitting a design, it’s a done deal,” said Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff.  The President wants “change” in the currency and we’ve unanimously picked Dowling Duncan’s work.  Fed Chairman, Benjamin Bernanke, has signed off on our choice for the redesign.  We intend to have the money in circulation by December, 2012.”

Emanuel went on to say that there are plans to redo U.S. coins as well.  “We don’t need a complete redesign of our coins, but we do want to put President Obama on the penny and move President Lincoln to the nickel. Thomas Jefferson, who was on the nickel, will be… discontinued.”  Republican  Congressman Paul Ryan suggested President Obama be  put on both the “nickel and dime” instead of the penny.

Another American icon might also be replaced.  “Uncle Sam is outdated,” said Axelrod.  “We need to update this icon as well.  It will now be Uncle Barack.”

Republicans are apoplectic about the changes the Administration is proposing.  “They won’t get this passed when we get control of the house,” said Minority Leader John Boehner.  “Typical Republicans, they want to block everything, even a little meaningless design issue,” said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  “It doesn’t matter what they think, we’re going to pass this and every American will be carrying Obama dollars in their wallets and purses come December, 2012.”

Muhammad, 32, was questioned due to the heightened security measures that resulted from the presidential executive order. The suspect attempted to enter the country with a tourist visa and claimed to be visiting family in order to attend this year’s Super Bowl LI.

Former Attorney General, Sally Yates, who was ousted by President Trump after failing to support the executive order, released a public apology via popular social media, Snapchat.

“I would like to express a sincere and utter apology to President Donald J. Trump. Due to unforeseen circumstances, there is no way I could have predicted the outcome of the situation. If afforded the opportunity to continue my position as Attorney General, I would be more than ecstatic to comply.” 

Officials are waiting to release an official press statement. FBI Director, James Comey, commented “We are unsure if accomplices are still at large. Until matters are addressed, we will keep additional details from the public eye. The security of our nation is the number one priority.”

You may have heard the snowflakes crying and complaining from their mothers’ basements and their D.C. prison cells, those arrested for their massive temper tantrum in our Nation’s Capital last weekend, about how President Trump‘s staff removed the GLBT portals on the WhiteHouse.Gov site. Well, they’re crying even louder now, because today, PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED HIS PEOPLE TO REMOVE THE SPANISH SPEAKING AND TRANSLATING PORTALS ON THE WHITEHOUSE.GOV WEBSITE!

Liberal rag L.A. Times reports:

President Trump, who chided his opponents during the campaign for speaking Spanish, has made a tangible change to the White House website to eliminate bilingual access. The site, which the Trump administration took over on Friday, no longer includes an option for translation into Spanish… Spokesman Sean Spicer suggested the translation option may return but made no specific commitment on timing when asked about it Monday. He spoke generally about the high volume of work facing the technology team during the changeover. “We are continuing to build out the website…,” Spicer said. “We’ve got the IT folks working overtime on that now.” During a Republican primary debate, Trump lashed out at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush when he spoke Spanish. “This is a country where we speak English,” Trump said.

President Trump is spreading the message that we conservatives have been lamenting for years. This is America. We have a culture. We have a language. We have a set of laws and rules by which EVERYONE in this country is expected to abide.

Fake_27-Webpage,Idaho Mother Sentenced To Prison After Multiple Citations For Breastfeeding In Public,"Breast Feeding Mugshot EvenOriginal photo by Bradfordst Via Flickr (CC BY 4.0)
Heather Watson, a 32-year old mother and Baker County, Idaho, resident has been ordered to serve a 7-year prison sentence after receiving several indecent exposure citations for breastfeeding her 6 -month old daughter in public.

According to Heather’s husband, Rick Watson, his wife had received a total of 6 indecent exposure citations for breastfeeding their daughter Caylee in public. Heather most recently was arrested by officers at a nearby public park. According to police reports and statements from Watson, she had been sitting on bench supervising her 3 other children, age 2, 5, and 7, as they played with other children at the park when her baby become fussy and needed to be fed.

Idaho is currently the only state that has yet to pass a law allowing mothers to breastfeed in public without the consequences of indecent exposure. The only protection that nursing mothers have in Idaho is Jury Duty exemption. A Moveon.org petition was created by The Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition in effort to bring the state up to speed with the remainder of the states throughout the country that protect nursing mothers, however despite the petition’s 4,821 signatures, there is no indication that Idaho is anywhere close to passing new legislation.

In addition to serving a maximum 7-years in prison, because Watson was charged with multiple counts of indecent exposure, she will be required to register as a sex offender and will be placed on the National Sex Offender Registry.

According to Heather’s husband and close friends, she was an advocate for mother’s rights and commonly took to social media websites such as Facebook to rant about her frequent indecent exposure citations and to complain about being harassed for breastfeeding her young daughter in a myriad of public locations. The below message was posted to Facebook a few weeks ago by Heather after she received her 4th citation for indecent exposure – “I’m so frickin pissed off by the barbaric, stone-age, laws we have in Idaho. I seriously just received my 4th ticket for the “indecent exposure” of my breast while feeding Caylee in public. You can bet I’m filing this document straight to the IDGAF folder (the trash can)!”

Though Watson’s sentence is widely viewed as unnecessarily strict, Jude Walter Chapman, the sole judge presiding over Baker County and nearby Wiser, Idaho, made the following statement to reporters from a local ABC affiliate station, “We have laws in our state and due to Mrs. Watson’s repeated civil disobedience it’s is clear to me that she has little to no regard for the system our state was built upon. As a Judge, it’s not my job to create law, but to recognize and preside over it.”

As news of Watson’s sentencing has spread throughout the media, several public breastfeeding advocate groups have come together to demand change in Idaho’s current laws. They are asking anyone that disagrees with Judge Chapman’s ruling to voice your feedback by calling the Baker County Department of Justice at 785-273-0325.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
Fake_28-Webpage,New law now charging all violent protesters with terrorism spread the news and share this,"This is a disaster. In late December, State Senator Doug Ericksen proposed a new law that would give authorities the ability to charge protesters with ""economic terrorism,"" and slap them with serious felony charges that could lead to jail time, just for making their voices heard.

The outrageous bill, which has now had been formally introduced for consideration during the 2017 legislative session, would make any form of protest that causes an ""economic disruption"" a class C felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. It wouldn't just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism, it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as ""disruptive."" Broadly interpreted, this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience.

We’ve already hit our initial goal of 50,000 signatures on the petition. But now that the bill has been introduced, we need to get even more people speaking out. If everyone reading this shares the video, we can easily get 100,000 signatures before we deliver it to the Washington State lawmakers.

Charging protesters with terrorism clearly violates the First Amendment and is an attempt to silence legitimate dissent. Please sign the petition telling lawmakers to reject this dangerous legislation.
Here's the text of the petition:

""Organizing and participating in protests is a basic Constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment. I urge all lawmakers to reject any legislation that criminalizes protesters or labels protests as a form of ""economic terrorism.""",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Fake_30-Webpage,Trump Caught INVESTING in Dakota Pipeline Before Signing It,"CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.

Donald Trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.

The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.

The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.

Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.

The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump’s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.

Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.

And now we learn that “President” Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.

This should come as no surprise since Trump ‘s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.

This involvement is another example of Trump’s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.

According to Ethics experts, Trump’s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.

The blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.

The Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump’s support of the cruel actions of the police.

We must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.

It has not yet been confirmed whether the individuals in the divorce filings are indeed the former First Lady and Secretary of State, and the 42nd President of the United States. Neither Sec. Hillary Rodham Clinton or President Bill Clinton have issued statements addressing these revelations.

One political analyst who spoke to The Takeaway on the condition of anonymity said, ""A divorce at this stage of the campaign would deliver unbelievable momentum to the candidate, strike an unmistakable chord for Hillary's independence, and it would confound her conservative critics by blowing the email controversy out of the headlines and be the biggest political game-changing divorce of the last several centuries.""

Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!

According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”

Here’s the pledge:

From this time forward, [under God,]

I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,

whose democratic beliefs I share,

whose rights and liberties I respect, and

whose laws I will uphold and obey.

Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:

Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.

Super oppressive lyrics, right?

If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.

Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.

If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.

Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.

This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!

Either assimilate, or LEAVE.

They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.

It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!

It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!

Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.

This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.

Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?",http://ladylibertysnews.com/muslims-offended-kids-recite-national-anthem-claim-racist-force/,http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pledge-of-allegiance.png,['Todd Cooney'],http://ladylibertysnews.com,{'$date': 1481570451000},['http://youtube.com/embed/UsmuPI6BJdI'],"['http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/obama-and-drug-dealer-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Welfare-benefits1-300x180.jpg', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eaf118007f6e04fd684292ead8d61e8e?s=50&d=mm&r=g', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bachmann-and-burkas-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mayor-Beth-van-Duyn-300x180.jpg', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.ladylibertysnews_com,DomainId.40136', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/obama-and-drug-dealer-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pledge-of-allegiance.png', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bachmann-and-burkas-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15713125_10211915648833212_286222425_n.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/debbie-wasserman-larger-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/German-immigrants-go-home1-300x180.png', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Soros-crowd1-300x180.jpeg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jeff-Sessions-and-Trump-80x80.png', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pauline-Hanson-and-muslim-migration-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/muslims-in-streets-of-ny1-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jeff-Sessions-and-Trump-300x180.png', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20015427&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/angry-muslims1-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Women-shopping-in-burkas1-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pauline-Hanson-and-muslim-migration-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Welfare-benefits1-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/mayor-Beth-van-Duyn-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/politifacts-picture.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/angry-muslims1-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Women-shopping-in-burkas1-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Soros-crowd1-80x80.jpeg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ladylibertynewsfooterlogo.png', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/muslims-in-streets-of-ny1-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/starbucks-muslim-store-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/debbie-wasserman-larger-300x180.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/starbucks-muslim-store-80x80.jpg', 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/German-immigrants-go-home1-80x80.png']",http://ladylibertysnews.com/muslims-offended-kids-recite-national-anthem-claim-racist-force/,"{'ca_image': 'http://ladylibertysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pledge-of-allegiance-150x150.png', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.8.1', 'og': {'description': 'How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?

Fake_34-Webpage,John Hagee Calls For “Prosecuting Women Who Say God’s Name During Intercourse”,"“One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord’s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.”

“Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.

“Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.”

“Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.”

The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.”

Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/

Fake_35-Webpage,Japanese whaling crew eaten alive by killer whales 16 dead,"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.
The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.

The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.

Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.
The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.

“It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.

Some Greenpeace supporters have even celebrated the incident as a victory for the cause

Fake_36-Webpage,Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible,"The White House has approved the redesign of U.S. currency.  Barack Obama will be on the new dollar bill.

The Obama Administration feels that the American dollar is in bad need of a makeover.  They have partnered with the Dollar ReDe$ign Project to pick a new design for U.S. currency.  Currently, the design that the administration likes best was done by Dowling Duncan (a British duo), which features a unique vertical design.  It also features President Obama on the one dollar bill.

“We love the Dowling Duncan look.  They’ve come up with a creative design and put President Obama where he belongs… on number 1,” said David Axelrod, Senior Adviser to President Obama.



The Dollar Redesign Project was organized by creative strategy consultant Richard Smith.  He is still soliciting ideas for the dollar bill of the future. “Our great ‘rival’, the Euro, looks so spanky in comparison it seems the only clear way to revive this global recession is to rebrand and redesign,” the project notes on its website.

Here’s the web site for  The Dollar Redesign Project.

“Don’t waste your time submitting a design, it’s a done deal,” said Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff.  The President wants “change” in the currency and we’ve unanimously picked Dowling Duncan’s work.  Fed Chairman, Benjamin Bernanke, has signed off on our choice for the redesign.  We intend to have the money in circulation by December, 2012.”

Emanuel went on to say that there are plans to redo U.S. coins as well.  “We don’t need a complete redesign of our coins, but we do want to put President Obama on the penny and move President Lincoln to the nickel. Thomas Jefferson, who was on the nickel, will be… discontinued.”  Republican  Congressman Paul Ryan suggested President Obama be  put on both the “nickel and dime” instead of the penny.

Another American icon might also be replaced.  “Uncle Sam is outdated,” said Axelrod.  “We need to update this icon as well.  It will now be Uncle Barack.”

Republicans are apoplectic about the changes the Administration is proposing.  “They won’t get this passed when we get control of the house,” said Minority Leader John Boehner.  “Typical Republicans, they want to block everything, even a little meaningless design issue,” said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.  “It doesn’t matter what they think, we’re going to pass this and every American will be carrying Obama dollars in their wallets and purses come December, 2012.”

BREAKING: Trump Just Gave Every WORKING, LEGAL Man Woman And Child In The USA $612 EACH!

The program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:

While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of how much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus on spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.

Democrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don’t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also don’t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer:

One thing is for sure.

You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy:\r\nWhile deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of how much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus on spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family.\r\n\r\nDemocrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don’t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff.

Fake_39-Webpage,“It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again” says NRA President Jim Porter,"By Free Wood Post

HOUSTON — It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water.

Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

Fake_4-Webpage,The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads,"Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.

It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.

Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. ""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.

CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.

@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016

@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016

The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.

This is exactly how fake news spreads

But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.

The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.",http://theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston,http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg,['Nov Est'],http://theverge.com,{'$date': 1480032000000},[],"['http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BDjczkjZSskROKDL-J148Qrti2k=/0x0:1024x768/1200x800/filters:focal(431x303:593x465)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002053/drudgesiren.0.jpeg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56023895/9U3A2207__1_.0.jpg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56012857/acastro_170717_0000_0005.0.jpg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55991379/35668427212_5dcc08c4b8_o.0.jpg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56026583/lg_v30.0.png', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56007463/Aug_01_2017_21_42_59.0.gif', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56025853/9U3A2158.0.jpg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56025333/microsoft_eye_control_1.0.gif', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56024755/tesla_model_y.0.png', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56020281/usethis.0.0.png', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56022631/theunit1_2040.0.0.jpg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7533929/Screen_Shot_2016_11_25_at_10.33.00_AM.jpg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7533931/cnns_channel_accidentally_broadcast_hardcore_porn.jpg', 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56016597/Screen_Shot_2017_08_02_at_12.32.05_PM.0.png']",http://theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston,"{'outbrainsection': 'us-world', 'msapplication-TileColor': '#393092', 'description': 'It’s not a good look', 'author': 'Loren Grush', 'og': {'site_name': 'The Verge', 'description': 'It’s not a good look', 'title': 'The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads', 'url': 'http://theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston', 'image': {'width': 1600, 'identifier': 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg', 'height': 900}, 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'description': 'It’s not a good look', 'title': 'The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads', 'url': 'http://theverge.com/2016/11/25/13748226/cnn-accidentally-airs-porn-fake-news-boston', 'image': 'http://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sye0FzRVD4YBWJrAw-iQkowVJCc=/0x96:1024x672/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/52002051/drudgesiren.0.jpeg', 'site': 'verge', 'card': 'summary_large_image'}, 'sailthru.date': '2016-11-25', 'sailthru.title': 'The CNN porn scare is how fake news spreads', 'msvalidate.01': 'D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94', 'fb': {'app_id': 549923288395304}, 'msapplication-TileImage': 'http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7396113/221a67c8-a10f-11e6-8fae-983107008690.0.png', 'google-site-verification': 'IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4', 'sailthru.tags': 'general,the-verge', 'article': {'publisher': 'http://facebook.com/verge', 'published_time': '2016-11-25T15:16:56-05:00', 'author': 'http://facebook.com/logru'}, 'style-tools': 'http://theverge.com/style/community/372/72196ca7aae7a7d2e55720057de149d4/tools.css', 'sailthru.description': 'It’s not a good look', 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no'}"
Fake_40-Webpage,“Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If It’s Out Of Love”,"The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home.

“I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly.

Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.”

But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued.

“So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.”

“And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?” he concluded.

Fake_42-Webpage,Jimmy Carter ‘Medical Marijuana Cured My Cancer’,"While speaking to ABC News about the remission of his cancer, former President Jimmy Carter credited marijuana for killing of his cancer cells.
The Nobel winner thanked his doctors and family for their support through his brain cancer ordeal. He also thanked Terrance ‘Scooby’ Williams of Dr. Green’s Greenery, a pot dispensary in Oakland, CA, for helping him find the right strain of cannabis.
Carter told his medicinal regiment to Sawyer“I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right.
“Edibles are also good when traveling when smoking is not permitted.”
The future is bright for the 91-year-old humanitarian. Carter has resumed his house building for Habitat for Humanity and continues his weekly prayer service. “Marijuana is God’s medicine. I find indica is better than sativa, but there are plenty of good hybrids.“
Carter wasn’t endorsing pot smoking for everyone. “There is the right place and the right time to spark up a bowl. Don’t be a pothead but also be aware of the potential benefits of cannabis when used in moderation with the right music.
“I was never of big fan of alcohol but weed is the medicine I need. It also revived my love for peanuts. Have you ever eaten a peanut… on weed?”
With legal weed available in Colorado and Washington State and several states likely to pass the legalization next November during the Presidential elections, Carter will help support the cause in California, Oregon, and Massachusetts.
“Help build a house for those that need one and peace and sex above all else. I forget, what were we talking about?”",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Fake_44-Webpage,"Whoopi Goldberg: Navy SEAL Widow was ""Looking for Attention""","UPDATE: My Response to Whoopi Goldberg Suing Me

Whoopi Goldberg is in hot water after comments she made Wednesday regarding the Navy SEAL widow that was honored last night during President Donald Trump’s historical speech.

“She was just looking for attention. These military widows love their 15 minutes in the spotlight”, Goldberg said.

“If it were me I wouldn’t be able to leave the house. How can someone who is truly greiving go out there and be on TV. It just doesn’t make sense to me”

After last night’s demonstration where several democrats in leadership roles refused to stand while the widow was being honored, Goldberg continues to make the point that liberals lack a significant amount of class.

Fake_45-Webpage,BREAKING Leaked picture of Obama being dragged before a judge in handcuffs for wiretapping Trump,"After Trump made it clear that Obama had illegally tapped the phones at Trump Tower, the FBI issued a warrant for his arrest. Since then, little has been heard from the former president other than a denial.

This morning, Obama was stopped at a checkpoint at Toronto International Airport, where he was trying to fly to an unknown destination under the alias “Bruce Wilekenmeyer.” The CRMP officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the US Embassy.

After a short transport back to Washington, Obama was brought before a special session of US District Court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorney’s custody.

A court reporter who also moonlights for Breitbart took great personal risk to snap this photo since there are no photographs, video recording or any other recording devices allowed in federal courtrooms unless specifically ordered by a judge:

Fake_46-Webpage,FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap – Americas Last Line of Defense,"Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 20.1k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER

Former president and breaker of laws, Barack Obama, will either surrender himself or be picked up by the FBI sometime today to be booked and charged with unlawful use of authority, wire fraud and conspiracy to interfere with free elections after it was confirmed that he ordered the tapping of the phones at Trump Tower during the presidential election.

The order, which isn’t something even a president can do without the signature of a federal judge, was to listen in on Trump and his children to try to find a connection to Russia. Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.

Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama’s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:

“The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.”

The call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama’s phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will be pardoning him anytime soon.",http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/,http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630,"['About Stryker', ""Stryker Is A Constitutional Conservative Who Can't Stand The Lazy Cryba Fantasy World Liberals Live In Knowledge Is Power The Truth Will Set You Free May The Good Lord Bless Keep The United States Of America""]",http://thelastlineofdefense.org,{'$date': 1488639875000},[],"['http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-llod-site-header-2.jpg', 'http://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/83.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630', 'http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?resize=678%2C381', 'http://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/87.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'http://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/85.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'http://thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rated-S.jpg', 'http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/82.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/01de25360ee280d1bd8f0b9a1f25034e?s=90&d=wavatar&r=g', 'http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/80.jpg?resize=326%2C245', 'http://i2.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/radioalice.cbslocal.com20100704patriotic-pets-happy-birthday-usa.jpg?resize=500%2C375']",http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/,"{'generator': 'WordPress 4.8', 'og': {'site_name': 'Americas Last Line of Defense', 'description': 'Obama may have just bitten off more than he can chew.', 'title': 'BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap', 'url': 'http://thelastlineofdefense.org/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/', 'image': {'width': 1200, 'identifier': 'http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630', 'height': 630}, 'locale': 'en_US', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'image': 'http://i1.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/a1a.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&w=640', 'card': 'summary_large_image'}, 'msapplication-TileImage': 'http://i0.wp.com/thelastlineofdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eagle-flag.jpg?fit=270%2C270', 'article': {'published_time': '2017-03-04T15:04:35+00:00', 'modified_time': '2017-03-04T15:04:35+00:00'}, 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'}"

Fake_48-Webpage,Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His ‘Murder Trump’ Video,"Snoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video “Lavender,” in which he shoots Donald Trump. In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that’s not what got him in trouble.

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:

“No, man. I don’t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin’ that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That’s not violence…it’s survival of the species.”

The reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.

Fake_49-Webpage,GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!! – News 4 Everyday,"When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.

Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.

A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils.

State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.

Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.

“This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.

Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.

Here is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible?

Quran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.

I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.

Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority.

Is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?

Just for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different?

There is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.

While Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.

The threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans.",http://news4everyday.com/2017/06/26/georgia-becomes-first-state-to-ban-muslim-culture-in-historic-move-to-restore-western-values/,http://royalcolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/x4ujzdtn9uoh3jepyza5zg.png,[],http://news4everyday.com,{'$date': 1498435200000},[],"['http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/caitlyn-bathroom-150x150.jpg', 'http://royalcolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/x4ujzdtn9uoh3jepyza5zg.png', 'http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_2-150x150.png', 'http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/benji-taylor-150x150.png', 'http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image-42-660x330.jpeg']",http://news4everyday.com/2017/06/26/georgia-becomes-first-state-to-ban-muslim-culture-in-historic-move-to-restore-western-values/,"{'ca_title': 'GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!!', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.7.3', 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'ca_image': 'http://news4everyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image-42-660x330-150x150.jpeg'}"
Fake_5-Webpage,Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again “Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More”,"Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.

“It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”

Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I haven’t been able to do that in a long time,” she revealed.

“So, I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,” the singer revealed. “At this point I’m not sure whether that’s going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask that’ll cover my face, but what I do know is that’s the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. I’m too good looking to be changing my face at this age.”

“Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say – I guess I’ll need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House,” Gaga concluded.

Fake_50-Webpage,President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired’ – Americas Last Line of Defense,"Join America's Last Line of Defense And Share This Article Now! 3.6k SHARES SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER

Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:

President Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.

Ryan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:

Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.

Relate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.

This isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:

“Mr. Speaker…You’re fired.”

Fake_51-Webpage,NBC Just Fired Megyn Kelly Before Her New Show Begins,"Share Facebook

According to sgsnews:

NBC Just Fired Megyn Kelly Before Her New Show Begins.

Megyn Kelly turned down a $20 million payday to stay with the only trusted name in news for a daytime slot where she could play a white version of Oprah Winfrey on NBC for 25 percent less money. Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasn’t happy and demanded the format be changed.

According to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kelly’s new show:

“Megyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like she’s been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.”

The problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books, traveling assignments to dog shows and fashion week and even the addition of a musical guest. According to Maxwell Seawald, CEO of NBC Universal:

“Ms. Kelly wants to be a journalist. Unfortunately, after her stint at Fox News and the way she attacked President Trump, she lost her following. Our data tells us that our audience will tolerate and even learn to like her, but not as a political pundit or someone they should take seriously. She needs to think less Diane Sawyer and more Kelly Ripa.”

Unfortunately, Kelly couldn’t do that and the whole thing came to a head this afternoon, causing NBC to pay a severance clause of $150K to cancel her contract. NBC spokesman Hugh Levitt told Fox News:

“Megyn Kelly was a superstar until she took on Trump. Now she’s a laughing stock. She could have worked a year or two and made herself $25 million. Instead she’ll spend her days looking for someone else who needs a washed up hasbeen from Fox News who knows nothing but how to piss people off.”

Sorry, Megyn. It’s not like we didn’t all see this coming. Hasta la vista, baby.

Fake_52-Webpage,New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!,"New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!





This will blow your mind…Read how a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women.

“I met Stephawn when I was 19 years old,” explains Joshua Johnson on his blog.

He continues:

“At 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.

Johnson goes on to explain in great detail how he fell victim to a sexually promiscuous fugitive who is wanted for allegedly infecting at least 240 people with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.

Ladies, as you read Joshua’s story below, keep in mind that black women are the fastest growing HIV demographic in the U.S. due to bisexual men who in relationships with women because they are confused about their sexuality.

Gay and bisexual men, regardless of race, are more sexually promiscuous than their heterosexual counterparts, according to Seekingarrangement.com and other reports.

Authorities in New York City are offering up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of 31-year-old Isaac Don Burks, aka Stephawn Burks, Stefan Levine, Isaac Levine, Stefan Burks, and Walter Brooks.

Burks is described as an African-American male, medium brown skin, six feet two inches tall, weighing 185 pounds. The NYPD is looking for a fugitive they say has embarked on a terrifying campaign to “infect as many people as possible” with the HIV virus, and they caution that his victims could run into the hundreds.

Isaac Don Burks, 31, has been indicted on eight counts of criminal transmission of HIV, prosecutors announced Friday, and warned that Burks targets people via popular gay websites and networking apps, such as Adam4Adam, Grindr, Jackd, and BGCLive.

Burks, a black gay man from West New York, NJ, just outside Manhattan, who police say may have started his “mission to infect as many people as possible” with HIV as far back as ten years ago, was described as “sick in the head” by one alleged victim, who notes that Burks alluded to having possibly infected as many as 300 victims. The victrim, who did not wish to be publicly identified, recalls that Burks has been on a “downward spiral” since the death of his mother, and plies his prey with drugs and alcolhol, to “bring their guard down.”

According to New York City Health Department spokesperson Kate Caraway, this is the first time a HIV infected individual has spread HIV to so many victims.

“We want to make sure that anyone who may have injected drugs with, who may have had sex with him, does come forward and get tested,” she Caraway. “We want to make sure that they’re not spreading the virus to anyone else.”

Anyone with information regarding Burks’ whereabouts is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 888-CRIMESC (888-274-6372). Your call will remain anonymous.

This makes the report we did on Craig Lamar Davis passing HIV around the Full Gospel Baptist Church seem like nothing.

Now read Joshua Johnson story in his own words below:





Isaac Burks aka Isaac Don Burks Pictured Above

I met Stephawn, (Real Name: Isaac Burks – Isaac Don Burks), when I was 19 years old. I had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to attend Clark Atlanta University. At 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.

You see, my father was a pastor and my mother was a physician. I came from a very stable background, and my parents were heavily into the church. They controlled everything in my life. They financed my education, sent me money every month, and paid virtually every bill that I had. They wanted to see me succeed in life, and I didn’t want to disappoint them.

When I moved to Atlanta I met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation. I pulled strength from these men, and bonded with them immediately. They taught me that it was ok to be gay, and that life was too short to live my life for others. Over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men. I felt comfortable. I felt that I could express myself without judgement, and…. for the first time ever I felt accepted. As time passed by, I started coming out of the closet a little more each day. At first, I would never attend a gay club because of fear of being outed. My friends eventually talked me into attending a gay club for the first time. I was nervous! You see, I had a sister who attended Spelman College and four other male cousins who attended Clark. The last thing I needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation. That would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off, and they were the ones paying for my tuition, books, and college expenses.

I eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends. We loaded up into my friends Ford Explorer and headed over to a club called Traxx. Apparently, this was the gay club that everyone in Atlanta attended on Saturday. I remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym. It was huge! There had to be over 1,000 people in the place, and they were dancing the night away. Because we were underage, we couldn’t drink. Apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age, and no one in my party had one. After awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it. Clubs aren’t as fun when you are sober, and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off. While standing on the side I noticed a guy staring at me and smiling. He was very attractive, and every time I would catch him looking in my direction I would look the other way. This entire gay lifestyle was still new to me, so I didn’t know what to take his stares for. Eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation. He told me that I looked familiar, and asked me where I was from. I told him that I was from Charlotte North Carolina, and I couldn’t possibly look familiar. I had never been to a gay club, and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country. He asked me why I wasn’t drinking, and I told him we couldn’t buy drinks because we were all under 21. He offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense. I jumped at the offer, because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night. After all, no one comes to a club to have a bad time.

He returned minutes later with three drinks. The drinks he ordered for us were Long Island Iced Teas. I remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out. It was very strong. Rather than be rude and waste his money, I drank it slowly. Stephawn then asked why I was babysitting my drink. I asked what did he mean by that, because I had never heard the phrase used before. He told me to hurry up and finish my drink, he was going to order us another round. By the time the second round came, I was feeling nice. We continued to talk, and he kept buying me drinks.

After the third round I was borderline drunk, and so were my friends. Every time he ordered me a drink, he also ordered my friends a drink too. After awhile my friends wanted to leave, and I told him that I would catch up with him later. He asked me to stay a little longer, and promised to take me home. I ditched my friends, and for the rest of the night it was just me and him.

We ended up leaving the club an hour later. While taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on E. We pulled into an apartment complex in the Lindbergh area of buckhead. He told me to come up with him so I did. As soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me. We eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed. He started unbuckling my my pants, and I stopped him. I confessed that I was a virgin and didn’t have a clue what I was doing.

He told me to relax, and that everything was cool. He said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life, and that he could teach me how to have sex. He made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off. Then he took my pants off. I was tense and nervous. I didn’t know what to expect, but he was so attractive I wanted every ounce of this man. The first thing he did was start eating my ass and I moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed. Next he started sucking my d***k from the back while I was laying on my stomach. It felt amazing. I wanted to please him too, but he told me to chill and go with the flow. Then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his d***k on my ass crack. He grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand. He rubbed the lotion in my ass crack, and then put some on his index finger. He slowly put his finger inside of my ass. I moaned in extacy, because he was stroking my d***k while he was massaging my prostate with his finger. After awhile of fingering me, he tried to put his d***k in my ass raw. I immediately stopped him! I asked if he had a condom, and he said yea why? I said because I didn’t come to Atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me. He ran some line about being recently tested the week before, and I said that’s cool but we just met. If we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter. He jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser. I watched him put the condom on, and then I buried my face into the pillow. It was painful at first. I didn’t understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out. I had to stop him several times, because I could not take the pain. After about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient. I couldn’t take the d***k, and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain. I didn’t want to disappoint him, and I didn’t want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied. I decided to “man up” and squirted some more lube on my ass. I laid on my stomach, and put my face back into the pillow. He inserted his d***k inside of my ass, and this time it didn’t hurt as much. He started to increase his stroke, and I had no problem taking it. He was grabbing my waist, and I attempted to throw my ass back like I had seen in the porno movies. Whatever I was doing, he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy. After 10 minutes of f***king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum. As he came I felt a warm liquid inside of my ass. I jumped up and looked back and saw his d***k without a condom on it! I screamed what happened to the condom? He grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom. There was no cum in it, and it was by the foot of the bed. I ran to the bathroom, because it felt like I had to s***t. When I used the bathroom, his cum rushed out of my ass. It was allot. I kept thinking to myself that this motherf***ker took the condom off while f***king me. That was the only explanation for cum being in my ass, because I watched him put the condom on.

I came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face. I said nigga I just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass. I asked him if he took the f***king condom off. He said no. He said that it must have broke. I wasn’t buying it, and I searched around for the condom. I found the used condom on the bed, and started examining it. The condom wasn’t broke at all! I rolled it out, and there was nothing wrong with it. I screamed what the f***k did you do, because this condom isn’t broken. He told me that I was tripping, and I ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet. I filled the condom with water and it didn’t leak at all! When I did that, he told me to get the f***k out of his house. I felt betrayed, I was scared for my life, and I was hurt. I had heard about Atlanta being one of the cities with the highest AIDS rates in the country, and I was determined not to be a statistic.

I got my things, and got out of his house. This asshole didn’t even take me home, and it was 6am in the morning. As I waited outside of his apartments in the cold, I called a cab service. They arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home. The entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop. I didn’t answer his calls, because I didn’t want to talk to him. I was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while f***king me. There was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me. I know some guys get off by that, but I was disgusted by it.

The thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn. As the liquor wore off, I went into a deep depression. When I got to my dorm, I popped two tylenol pm’s and fell alseep.

I didn’t tell anyone about my experience. How could I explain that I had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected. I had just met this man. I didn’t even know his real name. When my friends asked me what happened, I said nothing and gave them a look that said “don’t ask me anymore questions!”. They didn’t ask, and I didn’t tell. That experience frightened me so bad that I decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education. That meant pulling back from my “gay friends” too, because I was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality. I started hanging more with my straight friends. After all, I had to keep my charade up. I had family that attended my school, so I couldn’t be seen with a bunch of gay men 24/7.

8 months later while home for Christmas break I had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup. This was something my mother made me do ever year since I can remember. My doctor asked me was I sexually active, and I said no. I told him that I had sex once, but that was it. I wasn’t sexually active, because I wasn’t actively having sex. He told me that he was going to include an HIV test in my regular blood work anyway. A few days later I received a call from his office. It wasn’t the doctor, it was one of the office workers. She was obviously new, because I didn’t recognize her voice. She told me that I needed to come in, because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me. I was confused. I asked her what “something” was, and she said that she couldn’t release this information over the phone and that I should come in Today. This was very unusual, because I had never had this happen before and I had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years. At first I thought it could be high blood pressure, because that ran in my family. There was also a chance of cancer, because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer. I borrowed my mothers car, and headed over to the doctor’s office. I didn’t want to scare her, so I didn’t mention what I was borrowing the car for.

I will never forget what happened next. As I arrived to my doctor’s office, I was told to have a seat in the waiting room. There was soft music playing that turned out to be Barry Manilow’s Daybreak, and it made my stomach turn! I hated that f***king song. I was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when I was being called into my doctor’s office to discuss my lab results. Before the song could end, the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room. It was cold, there was no window, and the light was very bright. Brighter than usual. He began to look over my charts and lab results. He grabbed my hand, which caught me off guard, and then said I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but your HIV results

came back positive. I swear I didn’t even hear the word positive, I just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion. I said, I’m sorry but there must be some mistake. I am not sexually active. I’ve only had sex once! I haven’t had oral sex, or any sexual activity with anyone but one person. He said that he would order additional tests, and they all came back positive.

I thought about committing suicide. I could not eat. I could not sleep. I could not focus on school. I couldn’t do anything but cry. My doctor couldn’t legally tell my mother I was HIV positive, but I was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co-pays for the HIV meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits. I tried to get in contact with Stephawn but his number was disconnected.

When I got back to school, I went over to the apartment complex where he lived but I couldn’t remember the apartment number. I had no way of reaching this guy. I wanted to kill him, and i was going to. I had a butcher knife and I was going to stab him thru the heart, because I knew this guy had given me HIV, because I didn’t have sex with anyone else. As time passed, I became so depressed that I eventually dropped out of school. I kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when I’m going to die soon. I lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail. I decided to drop out of school, because I didn’t know how to deal with it all. I had no one to turn to. I couldn’t tell my friends, and I couldn’t tell my parents. Can you imagine telling your mother that you are HIV positive after a one night stand. I couldn’t dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her.

Today I read the article about Isaac Burks and saw his picture. This is the same guy who told me his name was Stephawn. This is the guy that gave me HIV! He ruined my life. I finally ended up telling my parents because I could not afford to pay the co-pays for the medication and doctor visits. My mother didn’t cry, and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way. Later on that night as I got up to use the bathroom I heard her crying in her room. Tears immediately started pouring down my face and I ran to the kitchen. I slit my wrist. I wanted to die. I fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family. I have been in counseling, hiv support groups, and seeing a psychiatrist every since. Accepting the fact that I am HIV positive has been very hard. I still have not been able to return to school, and I have tried to kill myself 3 times since then.

To the sick f***k Isaac Burks, also known as Stephawn who gave me HIV, I hope you rott in hell. Now that I know his real name I will contact the authorities and tell my story. Every day I hope that things will get better, and it doesn’t. I ask “Why me?” every day. What did I do to deserve this? I have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone. I just know the minute I tell them my HIV status they will be out of the door. I am going to die alone. The last time I tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop. But I cant. I have nothing to live for. I am alive, but I am not living.

I cried as I typed this post. I relived it, but felt I had to share my story. After finally coming out to my friends with my story I later found out that there were others that this man infected with HIV.

I can only say i pray 4 the person or persons responsible for creating a false story about me spreading HIV to hundreds of people. I would love to get on here and bash every lie and false story that is floating around, but i have a life to live. I have friends and family who know and love me dearly and are in my corner. I am not a person who would intentionally bring pain and hurt to anyones life. I have seen what this disease does to people first hand losing my best-friend to this at such a young age. It baffles me to think that someone would actually have so much hate in their heart to make a factitious news article and take my past experiences to add more significance to the story. Loosing my mother was a very hard thing to deal with but to say im on a downward spiral of destruction because of this is outrageous. Im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie CANNOT WIN. See sometimes people are hurt so bad in life that they do things to others intentionally and maybe accidentally but this article was definitely intentional to hurt and assassinate my character and mainly make me out to be a monster. I pray for you whoever you are. See my GOD doesn’t allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent. I can say that i was always taught that the devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy. SATAN get behind me because no weapon formed against me shall prosper!!!!! For the ones who are spreading the story via internet i ask u WWJD, what if this was you or your brother, uncle, cousin, farther. I’m not madd because i know who i am and im better then this. When your life is going so good things come to make u backslide into worldly ways but i want. I dont have anyhing else really to say besides GOD BLESS you

Fake_53-Webpage,"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees","A South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce it’s number of white employees by 44.3% over the next five years. This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal “Black Empowerment” program.

For years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom’s middle managers are 30% white and it’s skilled labor force is 21% white.

The South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it’s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.

Eskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.

South Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it’s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.

DENVER, COLORADO -

With the new laws in effect in Colorado, major sports organizations are looking for ways to cash in on the newest legal cash crop in the state.

Sources are reporting that Major League Baseball’s Colorado Rockies plan to sell food items which contain marijuana at concession stands during games next season.

The first item on the list? Pot Brownies.

An official within the Rockies organization stated that the Rockies organization has given the green light to concession stands selling marijuana brownies.

High ranking officials in the Rockies organization say they are thrilled at the new menu item since they note that it will bring in tens of thousands of dollars per month.

The Rockies head office is hoping that the sale of marijuana brownies will also boost sales of other concession items. What better way to sell concessions that to give everyone in the stadium the munchies?

SIDENOTE: An inside source with the organization said that it appears that the strain of marijuana that will be used in the making of the marijuana brownies will be Durango Bango which is considered to be the very best weed in the Rocky Mountain State.",http://empiresports.co/colorado-rockies-baseball-team-to-sell-marijuana-brownies-at-their-concession-stands/,http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana.jpg,[],http://empiresports.co,{'$date': 1393548555000},[],"['http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/HomeDepot-220x180.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/tapout-shirt-deemed-inappropriate-for-casual-friday-too-douchey-for-rest-of-week-75x75.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baby-mermaid-220x180.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana-300x181.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AD-Square-01.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/baby-mermaid-75x75.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/themes/bresponzive_pro/images/default-image.png', 'http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8eee9fa07431846d350323bf3532ef34?s=60&d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D60&r=G', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts/no_thumb.jpg', 'http://assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pin_it_button.png', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PEBanner1.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Shocking-DNA-Results-Revealed-Body-Of-Elderly-Homeless-Man-Identified-As-Elvis-Presley-75x75.jpg', 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/es-logo-white-300x83.png']",http://empiresports.co/colorado-rockies-baseball-team-to-sell-marijuana-brownies-at-their-concession-stands/,"{'shareaholic': {'site_name': 'Empire Sports News', 'language': 'en-US', 'url': 'http://empiresports.co/colorado-rockies-baseball-team-to-sell-marijuana-brownies-at-their-concession-stands/', 'article_author_name': 'IamShado', 'image': 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana.jpg', 'site_id': '2fce6ed179531db24e7a3f66a3e1943a', 'article_published_time': '2014-02-28T05:49:15+00:00', 'article_modified_time': '2017-08-02T21:00:39+00:00', 'keywords': 'baseball, brownies, colorado rockies, concessions, drug laws, marijuana, mlb, pot, headlines, news', 'wp_version': '7.2.0.0'}, 'ca_image': 'http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Enpire-sports-colorado-rockies-pot-brownies-marijuana-150x150.jpg', 'generator': 'NGFB Open Graph+ 7.2G', 'og': {'site_name': 'Empire Sports News', 'description': 'DENVER, COLORADO - With the new laws in effect in Colorado, major sports organizations are looking for ways to cash in on the newest legal cash crop in the state.

Fake_57-Webpage,BREAKING Autopsy Results From Vince Foster’s Exhumed Body–Cause Of Death To Be Changed,"A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster’s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide.
.
With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn’t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide.
.
LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital’s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible.
.
The doctor who signed Foster’s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice.
.
The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster’s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau’s resources are made available.
.
In other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder…again.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Nagalese prevents vitamin D being produced In the body

Neon Nettle reported on the epidemic of doctors being murdered, most of which were in Florida, U.S.

These scientists all shared a common trait; they had all discovered that Nagalase enzyme protein was being added to vaccines which were then administrated to humans.

Nagalese is what prevents vitamin D from being produced in the body, which is the body's main defense to naturally kill cancer cells.

(SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO)

According to Thebigriddle.com: Nagalase is a protein that's also created by all cancer cells. This protein is also found in very high concentrations in autistic children. And they're PUTTING it in our vaccines!!

This prevents the body from utilizing the Vitamin D necessary to fight cancer and prevent autism. Nagalese disables the immune system. It's also known to cause Type 2 Diabetes. So basically…they weren't killing these doctors because they had found the cure to cancer or were successfully treating autism… they're killing them because these Dr's had been researching and had the evidence that the vaccines they're injecting our precious children with are CAUSING our current cancer and autism crisis!!

And that it's obviously being done knowingly and on purpose! The Dr's they killed in FL had been collaborating and were getting ready to go public with the information.



Depopulation 101..add poison to vaccines…make it law that all children must be injected to attend school. Slow kill methods. They think they're being fair w/ their ""survival of the fittest"" type mentality. Only the best genes survive? These people have no souls.",http://neonnettle.com/videos/473-doctors-who-discovered-cancer-enzymes-in-vaccines-all-found-murdered,http://neonnettle.com/videos/images/fronmain22.jpg,"['Jack Murphy', 'Neon Nettle']",http://neonnettle.com,,[],"['http://neonnettle.com/news/images/cancer-causing-drinking-water.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/pope-gives-early-retirement-to-pedophile-priest-caught-raping-children-t30617.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/features/images/air-france-jet.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/north-korea-war-preperationthumb.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/elija-wood-pedo-ring-t9217.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/15-children-dead-after-botched-vaccine-program-t10617.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/videos/images/fronmain22.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/sphere/images/sandythumb23.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/dr-phil-cancelled-after-exposing-elite-pedophile-ring-t4417.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/sphere/images/trumpthumb11.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/videos/images/elite-safe-house.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/norway-pedo-ring-t121216.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/cps-gives-toddler-to-pedophiles-who-rape-and-torture-her-t1817.jpg.jpeg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/abortion-drugs-discovered-in-bill-gates-vaccines-t10617.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/911-saudi.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/feed/images/top-20-conspiracy-theories-t21517.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/features/images/north-korea-war-imathumb.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/features/images/preist-with-hiv-who-raped-30-children-forgiven-by-the-church-maint2517.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/katy-perry-collapses-amid-mind-control-mk-ultra-meltdown-t13617.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/cancer-patient.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/sphere/images/millions-of-school-issued-computers-found-spying-on-children-without-parents-consent-t17717.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/features/images/first-elite-democrat-pleads-guilty-child-rape-pedophile-pedogate-t21317.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/trump-stopped-covert-cia-operation-in-syria-after-seeing-disturbing-video-t2817.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/motel-priest.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/justin-bieber-church-pedophile-secret-exposed-t2817.jpg', 'http://neonnettle.com/news/images/retired-mi5-agent-death-bed-confession-i-killed-princess-diana-t19617.jpg']",,"{'description': 'Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Found Murdered - Nagalese prevents vitamin D being produced In the body', 'author': 'Neon Nettle', 'og': {'site_name': 'Neon Nettle', 'description': 'Nagalese prevents vitamin D being produced In the body - Neon Nettle reported on the epidemic of doctors being murdered, most of which were in Florida, U.... | NEON NETTLE', 'title': 'Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Found Murdered', 'url': 'http://neonnettle.com/videos/473-doctors-who-discovered-cancer-enzymes-in-vaccines-all-found-murdered', 'image': {'width': 620, 'identifier': 'http://neonnettle.com/videos/images/fronmain22.jpg', 'height': 340}, 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'image': 'http://neonnettle.com/features/images/fronmain22.jpg', 'creator': '@neonnettle', 'description': 'Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Found Murdered', 'card': 'summary_large_image', 'title': 'Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Found Murdered'}, 'msapplication-TileColor': '#da532c', 'MobileOptimized': 320, 'HandheldFriendly': 'True', 'fb': {'admins': 761055017}, 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1', 'article': {'publisher': 'http://facebook.com/neonnettle', 'author': 'http://facebook.com/neonnettle'}, 'theme-color': '#ffffff'}"
Fake_59-Webpage,Police Find 19 White Female Bodies In Freezers With “Black Lives Matter” Carved Into Skin,"Rasheed Thompson, 39 of Chicago, was arrested in connection with a series of dead bodies found in a freezer located in his basement. According to reports, the bodies had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads of the corpses.

The Chicago coroners office made a gruesome discovery today after several 911 calls were placed by neighbors regarding their concern of suspicious activity at the residence of Thompson. At approximately 8 p.m., police were dispatched to South Pulaski Road and West Lexington Street. Upon their arrival, their arrival, authorities were met by a group of residents at the corner where they assisted police in locating the home in question. Police proceeded to the 3000 Block of West Lexington Street where they located the home. Authorities knocked on the door of the residence and was met by an African-American male, who appeared to be in his late 30’s and seemed to be “under the influence of drugs”.

Upon entering the home, authorities indicated that the home “smelled of death”. The power was off in the house however authorities found a gasoline powered generated running in the kitchen.

“A Black male, approximately in his 30’s, opened the door with the smell of alcohol and marijuana on his body. He appeared to be somewhat disoriented and his speech was slurred. We asked him for permission to enter the premises, however he seems reluctant to allow us to enter,” said Lt. Kyle Jennings. “After a few seconds, he mumbled “yes” to us. Once we entered the home, we were met with a very foul odor as if something was dead in the home. The power was off so we used our flash lights to look around. As we approached the rear of the home, a light was on in the kitchen. We asked the occupant for his name. He identified himself and told us he lived with his grandmother. In the kitchen, we found several handsaws covered in blood. Mr. Thompson pushed one of the officers and ran downstairs through a half-opened door in the kitchen.”

In the kitchen, we found several handsaws covered in blood. Mr. Thompson pushed one of the officers and ran downstairs through a half-opened door in the kitchen.”

Lt. Jennings and two other officers chased Thompson down the stairs which is where the foul odor had gotten stronger. When the officers got to the basement, they found a series of freezers scattered around the basement. With no trace of Thompson, one officer continued to search for him as the other two pried opened three locked deep freezers. Upon their discovery, 11 decapitated bodies were found frozen, while the heads where in ziplock freezer bags. All of the bodies appeared to have been Caucasian women, possibly in their early to mid-20’s. The heads that were found all had the words “Black Lives Matter” carved into the foreheads. The bodies were were preserved, possibly from being stored in the deep freezers.

The police radioed for back up and the other freezers were opened where 8 more bodies in similar condition were found, however one of the women was still alive. Authorities at the scene helped the woman out of the freezer and waited for paramedics to arrive.

“I was kidnapped by this Black guy after I left work earlier today. We talked for while at Starbucks, where I work, before everything happened. At first he seemed pretty nice but he had this weird twitch that happened every couple of minutes. He asked if he could walk me to my car and I said yes, but that is when everything went dark. When I woke up, I was in this basement and I saw that guy I was with earlier taking saws up the stairs. I cried for help and that is when he stuffed me into a freezer where I saw dead bodies. I must have passed out from shock or something but I am happy you guys found me,” said to police by the victim.

Officer Douglas, who was searching for Thompson, found him in a crawl space in the basement. Police ran a background check on him and discovered that he was arrested during a protest for the police involved shooting death of Laquan McDonald.

Fake_60-Webpage,2 Liberal Democrat Congressmen Arrested For Planning Trump’s Assassination,"Need more proof that liberalism is a disease? Two United States Representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of President Trump. These aren’t some off-the-hook left wing extremists, they’re typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.

Rep. Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.

According to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men’s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. It’s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:

“Their plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a ‘design for a new video game,’” said Special Agent George Ketterman, “While they never actually used the president’s name or purchased any of the items listed in the ‘game,’ like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.”

In unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trump’s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.

NBC News tried to reach out to the men’s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn’t find one. It would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the Patriot Act.

Fake_61-Webpage,Evangelical Leader Says Those Who Oppose Trump Could Be “Punished” with Gay Child,"Donald Trump may be an adulterer, he may be crude, and he may have cheated people out of the money he owed them. If you doubt that Donald Trump is God’s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:

“It’s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he’s not. And we know that he’s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. That’s not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We don’t choose them.”

“All we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they’ve been chosen and know that that’s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children’s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.

Evangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert’s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:

“If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.”

Copeland appeared on Colbert’s “Pray for America” call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.

Fake_62-Webpage,"“If A Woman Is Not Intelligent Enough To Keep Her Legs Closed, How Can We Entrust The Abortion Decision To Her?” – WalkWithHer","Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called “heartbeat bill,” a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman’s life or preventing the “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”

“At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,” Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. “Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I’m sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.”

He continued, “Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there’s one very simple reason why I did it. That’s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.”

“A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we’re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child – a being who’s done no wrong and only exists as its mother’s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?” Kasich said. “I don’t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.”

“And I’ll tell you another thing – as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn’t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,” the governor concluded.

Fake_63-Webpage,"Vin Diesel Had This to Say About the Residents of Rockford, Illinois – WBN 12 News","Share this on Facebook: Facebook

Share this on Facebook: Facebook

ROCKFORD, Illinois – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Rockford, Illinois when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rockford – some place on State Street, I think – and got a burger. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

I’m telling you, these people in Rockford are the real deal. I’m going to move there after I retire,” Diesel said with a laugh.

Diesel added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Rockford, Illinois. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”

Do you support to deport them?,"A highly regarded Texas law enforcement officer was shot and killed Monday moments after arriving for work in an attack that prompted a massive manhunt for the gunman.

The shooting of Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood did not appear to be random, according to Baytown police Lt. Steve Dorris, but a motive was not immediately clear.

“Whether or not he was specifically targeted, or whether this was because of the uniform he was wearing or the place he pulled up to in the morning, we just don’t know that right now,” Dorris said.

No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Dorris said authorities were still “actively investigating” the shooting.",http://usafirstinformation.com/texas-law-enforcement-officer-fatally-shot-upon-arriving-work-3-muslim-refugee-support-deport/,http://usafirstinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ofice.jpg,"['Shirley Reed Baggett', 'Carolyn Mckinney', 'Elizabeth Davis', 'Lorraine Perry']",http://usafirstinformation.com,{'$date': 1493666765000},[],"['http://usafirstinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/netanyahu-80x60.jpg', 'http://i0.wp.com/truetrumpers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/aptopix-officer-killed-san-antonio.jpg?resize=618%2C348', 'http://usafirstinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ofice.jpg', 'http://usafirstinformation.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9-11-80x60.jpg', 'http://i0.wp.com/truetrumpers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ct-texas-officer-fatally-shot-20170403-001.jpg?resize=618%2C348']",http://usafirstinformation.com/texas-law-enforcement-officer-fatally-shot-upon-arriving-work-3-muslim-refugee-support-deport/,"{'og': {'site_name': 'UsafirstInfo', 'description': 'A highly regarded Texas law enforcement officer was shot and killed Monday moments after arriving for work in an attack that prompted a massive manhunt [...]', 'title': 'Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 muslim refugee.

Fake_65-Webpage,Tampa man loses testicles after trying to 'fill scuba tank with weed smoke',"A 32-year old Tampa local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to ‘fill a scuba tank with weed smoke’ failed spectacularly last night. According to the testimony of several witnesses, Darren Winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.

“Darren’s a recreational diver,” commented one of the injured man’s friends. “For some time, he’s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he’d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.”

Mr Winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence, an apartment in Ybor, telling them he’d finally perfected what he called his ‘scuba bong’. “Clearly it wasn’t a bong at all,” pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists, “but he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him.”

When his friends assembled at Mr Winter’s residence, they found him heavily intoxicated. “He’d had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived, as he was so delighted to finally have his ‘scuba bong’ up and running.” With his friends present, Mr Winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the home-made device in action. This is the point that everything went horribly wrong.

According to the witnesses, Mr Winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled, knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor. “The tank basically exploded after [Winters] knocked it over,” commented one of the witnesses. None of Winter’s friends were injured, but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body.

Winter’s friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital, where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds. His condition has now been downgraded from ‘critical’ to ‘serious’, but medical staff announced they’d been unable to save his testicles which had been ‘cleanly severed’ by a shard of metal.

Preliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by Winters may be banned from dive use throughout the US. “This tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing,” commented the lead investigator on the case. “We regularly audit dive shops in Tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold; however, the ban only extends to using the tank when diving. If [Winters] purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis, the retailer has technically not breached the law.”

This news will be little comfort to Mr Winters, who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank. The young man faces a long recovery, but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through. “He’s one of the toughest guys I know,” commented one of Mr Winter’s friends. “He’ll take the fact he won’t be able to have kids pretty hard, though.”

Correction: An earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed. Mr Winters is actually employed on a part-time basis at a Tampa pizza restaurant. We regret the error.

Fake_66-Webpage,United Airlines Flight Attendant Slaps Crying Baby During Flight,"During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.

The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”

After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother’s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.

The flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.

The little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries.

Fake_67-Webpage,MALIA OBAMA EXPELLED FROM HARVARD,"Malia Obama, who has decided that as an adult she wants to be a pot smoking, rap listening, twerking party girl, has been ousted from the student roster at Harvard University. The school’s chancellor, Malcolm Little, said that regardless of her status as a former first daughter, the rules are the rules and she won’t be welcome there this fall.

The stunning announcement came after Malia was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends. Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is “weed friendly,” but that doesn’t change the fact that she broke the rules.

Malia’s lawyer has pointed out that the school has turned the other way on the marijuana issue when their entire rowing team, made up of 14 white males, was caught selling and smoking marijuana cigarettes during the offseason. Chancellor Little remarked that the difference was that the members of the rowing team are hard-working, established students whose parents are paying cash for their education while Malia hasn’t attended yet, isn’t planning on playing a sport and is going to the school on a combination of a scholarship from the Clinton Foundation and taxpayer-funded grants.

Fake_68-Webpage,Trump on Revamping the Military,"COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.

“I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.”

Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.”

Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.”

The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.”

Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California’s Republican convention on Friday.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/04/trump-on-revamping-the-military-were-bringing-back-the-draft/,http://realnewsrightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/trump-reinstate-draft.jpg,"['Cheryl

Fake_69-Webpage,Eric Trump ‘My Father’s Tax Return Is Irrelevant Because We’re Going To Cancel Taxes For WEALTHY People Anyway’,"President Donald Trump was very active on Twitter Easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns, saying he shouldn’t have to show them since he “easily won the Electoral College.” Moments after he defended no longer calling China a currency manipulator, now that they are giving him a helping hand with North Korea, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on Twitter. “I did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?” Trump tweeted.

As always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trump’s second son argued that his father’s tax return is “irrelevant,” largely because “he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.” He said, “When you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.”

Eric continued, “And while we’re on the subject, I kind of have to say, it’s funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. That’s kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, I’m not saying something that’s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that he’s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. That’s a catastrophe.”

The self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to “fix” the broken tax system of the United States. “At the end of the day, it’s irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. It won’t matter soon anyway,” Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that “cancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.” “It’s our way of saying ‘good job’ to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.”

“As for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn’t have to pay tax; like I said, it’s a sort of ‘thank you’ from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess they’ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, that’s where we’re going with this. Bottom line, if you’ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And you’re going to have to pretty soon,” Eric concluded.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]
Fake_7-Webpage,ProLifers Declare Ejaculation Is Murder Every Sperm Cell Is A Life,"The pro-life movement in the USA have stated that they believe that human life starts at the moment of conception and so the human fetus can be considered a human being, and hence they should have their rights to live.



Recently, another argument broke out last month which has created a huge debate regarding abortion. Different religious groups have different views on this topic. Pro-lifers have stated that they believe that ejaculation is equivalent to murder and there should be laws to stop that.



Rachel Stratt, a pro-life activist commented that conception is the starting point of life, and that is why they don't believe in birth control. According to them, semen has been provided by the Almighty for a particular purpose to seed life and wasting it is simply showing your disrespect towards God. They believe that every sperm cell is life, and ejaculation means killing all those babies.



The pro-life protesters are now asking the government to make a law which would make ejaculating for own gratification illegal throughout the USA. So many lives are lost only because men ejaculate watching p0rn videos on adult sites like Pornhub just to satisfy themselves. This is murder, there is an urgent need to protect the sperms, and the babies.

In fact, a petition was submitted on Change.org stating that sperm wastage due to self-satisfaction should be made illegal, and it has already received over 85,000 signatures. It needs another 15,000 signatures before the White House will be reviewing it. 38 women who are in the White House reported that this bill would be passed if that opportunity ever arises.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Fake_71-Webpage,Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US,"President Donald Trump has sent a strong message to the Russia Federation over the country’s ban on the “peaceful activities” of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Trump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the country’s own constitution against them.

“You know right that this is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russia Federation. I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you” – Trump warned.

Trump went on to invite all Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia.

“As this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.” – Trump urged.


Supreme Court judge Yuri Ivanenko reads the decision in a courtroom in Moscow Thursday AP

Russia’s Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.

The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.

The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the group’s administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.

“The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russia’s ministry of justice and deem the ‘Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia’ organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,” said judge Yuri Ivanenko. “The property of the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization is to be confiscated to the state revenue.”

A lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents “pose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public security”.

Fake_72-Webpage,Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across US,"Year 2017 does not seem to be going well for the United States of America. Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.

On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.

Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. ""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.

Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.

Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.

The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.

Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.

In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.

Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.

Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.

Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.

On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.

Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.

Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.

Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.

Ted Nugent, 70’s rocker turned hunting guide and conservative icon, was shot and killed early this morning in a tragic hunting accident. While setting up his tree stand just outside a wildlife reserve in Montana, Nugent was fired on and hit in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear.

Details are still coming out, but apparently Nugent often hunts this are for animals that stray from the preserve. He was just setting up before dawn without any reflective or hunter’s orange visible, wearing a fur hat he would typically change for a camo and orange version once the sun came up.

The hunter who shot him faces manslaughter charges as the shot rang out and was recorded by a local game warden a full 15 minutes before dawn, which is the legal start of the day for hunting. The identity of the hunter hasn’t been released. He was arrested and booked at the State Police barracks in Boseman. Nugent’s family has been notified.

Trump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back.

Graham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.”

“If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.”

Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson.

“There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.”

Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage.

“I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday.

“Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep.

O’Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That’s when the “tolerant” liberals got violent.

One of the men grabbed O’Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.

O’Reilly was taken to St. Vincent’s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O’Reilly’s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.

The family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O’Reilly “got what he deserved” for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.

Liberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don’t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be “tortured,” but it’s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he’s done.

Liberalism is truly a mental disorder!",http://newsfeedhunter.com/bill-oreilly-in-critical-condition-after-being-attacked-by-tolerant-liberals/,http://newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg,[],http://newsfeedhunter.com,{'$date': 1493920877000},[],"['http://i0.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-4.40.16-PM.png?resize=192%2C96', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b58000cb3117844aaace93c5b8de7919?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/poopy-pants.jpg?resize=364%2C205', 'http://newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg', 'http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c5cc67f0ab790ff909ffd934046adf98?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3e5907056f85185321a16f85ffe5dba0?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amb-1.jpg?fit=748%2C420', 'http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4c7ac4170ae7265973cb7d9e8c460600?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/morgue.jpg?resize=364%2C205', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19.jpg?resize=364%2C205', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/33.jpg?resize=192%2C96', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/19.jpg?resize=192%2C96', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/38.jpg?resize=364%2C205', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2fbefb2bc8d692e4f7ea76c012c77ac2?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/10.jpg?resize=364%2C205', 'http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d95c357dbf31a3996f144aa2cbe23803?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e87758322912116647cdcfeaeadc4526?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/85630713a01533510943d1ebc9231b48?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b6eef0297eac81b1f0f9e5049ec75745?s=40&d=mm&r=g', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/38.jpg?resize=192%2C96', 'http://i0.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/47.jpg?resize=192%2C96', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/malia.jpg?resize=364%2C205', 'http://i2.wp.com/newsfeedhunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/41.jpg?resize=192%2C96']",http://newsfeedhunter.com/bill-oreilly-in-critical-condition-after-being-attacked-by-tolerant-liberals/,"{'description': 'Bill O’Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were “disgusted” by his behavior towards women at Fox News.

Fake_77-Webpage,BREAKING Clinton Foundation Ordered To Cease Operations – Chelsea Charged With Fraud,"As we know, Clinton Foundation has been given an A+ as a charitable organization. It slightly made more reputable than the Red Cross. Now, it has been ordered to cease operations. Chelsea Clinton, the CEO, has been charged with fraud and a warrant issued for her arrest. But, following this news, Clintons were nowhere to be found for an interview.

The reason behind the shutdown is the alleged ‘’pay for play’’ donations that saw rich and powerful terrorists gain access to Washington DC in exchange for cash. During Clinton’s time as Secretary of State, it’s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with Obama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. Then, the creator of ISIS, Osama Bin Laden was sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death.

So, it all comes down to how Chelsea Clinton used her family foundation’s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents. Doug Band, formerly a top aide to President Bill Clinton, griped about the former first daughter’s spending in a Jan.4, 2012, email released by WikiLeaks.

“The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents…,” Band wrote to John Podesta, now Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.

“I hope that you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road…”

A chain of emails was hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and WikiLeaks has released more that 50,000 of the stolen emails over the past 32 days.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

His daughter Anna Armstrong posted on Wednesday morning that Lance passed away at 2:40 a.m.

“Bereft and full of grief, but still strangely peaceful in the knowledge that he is now free from all suffering,” Anna posted on Facebook.

Sources say the former cyclist, who won 2004 Tour de France had stage 4 colon cancer which he battled secretly.

“He carried on very well, at least for two years and underwent chemotherapy and stem cell therapy,” the source said. However, Lance developed infections and succumbed to pneumonia, which later developed into sepsis.

Fake_79-Webpage,Fox Star Tucker Carlson In Critical Condition After Head On Collision Driving Home – We Conservative,"1.1k SHARES Share Tweet

According to America’s Last Line Of Defense:

Fox News’ bright and shining primetime star, Tucker Carlson, was involved in a hit and run head-on collision on his way home from his live broadcast of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” which is shot at Fox News in New York City. NYC Police Sargeant Michael O’Leary told reporters that while he couldn’t confirm the identity of the driver, a well-known news anchor was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident.



EMT’s on the scene were heard on their radios describing the man as Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson after retrieving his wallet. He was transported to Saint Mary’s where he is said to be in critical condition and awaiting surgery. No other information is available from the hospital, which also refuses to release anything until they get the OK from police.



The car that crossed the median and struck Carlson had a reinforced bumper and the steering wheel was covered with foam to provide the driver extra protection from a crash. It’s obvious that someone wanted to do harm to another human being on purpose. Whether or not Carlson was specifically targeted or just in the wrong place at the wrong time remains unknown. The perpetrator fled the scene. The Ford Explorer he was driving had no plates or VIN numbers. Police have impounded it as evidence.



Our thoughts and prayers are with Tucker’s family tonight. This is a developing story that will be updated.

Fake_8-Webpage,Pence: “Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had”,"Mike Pence said he didn’t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for “speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior” – which she said had “shaken (her) to the core.”

“First and foremost,” Pence argued, “I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That’s the first thing I don’t quite get. Secondly, if she’s the First Lady, shouldn’t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What’s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That’s not what she should be doing.”

The governor of Indiana also said that she “has no business” commenting on men and their “restroom talk,” as well as that that’s not “ladylike behavior.” “Now, I know that the word ‘lady’ is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she’s not behaving like one, at least as of late,” he said. “If she was a real lady, she wouldn’t be commenting on men’s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.”

He continued, “If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn’t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she’s not only being vocal about it, but she’s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can’t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can’t fool me, just like she can’t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.”

“How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?” Pence asked. “He has apologized for it several times, and I really don’t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn’t enough, the first lady also thinks she’s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That’s just ridiculous.”

“There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn’t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I’m actually glad that’s the case because when Donald wins, we’ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,” Pence concluded.",http://politicono.com/pence-michelle-obama-vulgar-first-lady-weve-ever/,http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o.jpg,['Alex Stevan'],http://politicono.com,{'$date': 1476468568000},[],"['http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dakota_Meyer_with_President_Obama-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thousands_protest_against_anti_gay_Charles-Worley-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/hqdefault.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/130729170454-lead-intv-ted-cruz-full-00060416-story-top-150x150.jpg', 'http://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o-645x325.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16688738525_e8f6703b04_o.jpg']",http://politicono.com/pence-michelle-obama-vulgar-first-lady-weve-ever/,"{'description': 'satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.8', 'og': {'site_name': 'Newslo', 'description': '“This is too well organized to be an accident.

Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.

The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds – literally.

This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.

However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.

It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.

It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.

“We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.”

This method was developed by the KGB, which became the FSB following the fall of the USSR.

What we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for Donald Trump is that they were being influenced, whether through cash payments, blackmail or space beams, by Russian agents from the FSB (formerly the KGB).

“If people were not beholden to Russia, they would have voted for Hillary Clinton,” a senior agent said, citing a definitive analysis by CrowdStrike, a contractor hired by the DNC to investigate Russian space-beam mind control.

When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.”

Senator Chuck Schumer called the response from Peskov “predictable,” adding, “what do you expect from the criminal Putinist regime that kills journalists, oppresses gays, invaded the Ukraine, murdered innocent Syrians and hacked our elections by controlling people’s brains with a space-beam?”

Upon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million American voters are working directly for Russia, Senator John McCain has called for mass arrests. He referred to all Trump voters as “radical traitors to the core values and principles of democracy and human rights,” and demanded they be imprisoned and their homes given over to Syrian refugees.

Fake_81-Webpage,JEFFERSON DAVIS STATUE TO BE REPLACED WITH OBAMA LIKENESS,"Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years.

As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.

“This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.

The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.

“It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.”

The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.

Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.

Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.

“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.”

Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.”

As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter

Fake_82-Webpage,Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death - Story,"Seth Rich Seth Rich

- EDITOR'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.

What he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.

In an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:

FOX 5 DC: “You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...”

WHEELER: ""For sure...""

FOX 5 DC: “...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?""

WHEELER: ""Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

In the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.

Since Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.

On Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as ""miscommunication.""

When asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.

We reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, ""The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.""

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original story:

It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.

Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.

Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.

Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that ""the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""

Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.

Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich’s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.

""The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” said Wheeler. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, “Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.""

Wheeler also told us, ""I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.’ Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].

Wheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.

FOX 5's Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheeler’s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.

The family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:

""As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.""

Fake_83-Webpage,Donald Trump Praises Colonel Sanders for His Service in the Civil War,"Fresh off his gaffe involving President Andrew Jackson and the Civil War, Donald Trump has made yet another historical faux pas regarding the “War of Northern Aggression.” In an interview with The Red Shtick, Trump regaled us with his other thoughts on the war that an angry Jackson totally saw coming.

Trump has been struggling to defend his comments — widely deemed preposterous, even by St. Landry Parish educational standards — in which he claimed a man who owned as many as 300 slaves would’ve found a way to prevent the Civil War.

The Donald, a member of the Party of Lincoln, elaborated on his recent controversial remarks about how the first Democratic U.S. president, who died 16 years before the Civil War, would have managed to avoid a war the first Republican president could not.

Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.

Speaking to our intern Dave Robicheaux, who is paid in Facebook likes, Trump insisted Col. Harland Sanders, whom he called a “tremendous Civil War hero,” once saved an entire army at Valley Forge from certain starvation. Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.

Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.

Upon being confronted with these facts, The Donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a Confederate monument removal protest in New Orleans while screaming about fake news.

Church’s Chicken and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen were unavailable for comment.

Incidentally, Trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies’ restaurants if they don’t share their respective secret recipes with him.

The Red Shtick will update this story as new attacks from the White House on history and our deep-fried way of life develop.

Fake_84-Webpage,"NASA Will Pay You $18,000 To Stay In Bed And Smoke Weed For 70 Straight Days","We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it’s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.

If you’re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you’re prepared for.

NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their “Rest Studies” – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.

So what is the exact purpose of these studies?

These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts’ health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.

The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.

This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:

Examining how the astronauts’ changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.

Examining if the astronauts’ physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.

Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.

The study’s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.

The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.









The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you’re in the exercising or non-exercising group.

Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you’ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you’ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You’ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.

During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body’s immunity system.

But is it worth it?

You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can’t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.

This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you’ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.",http://thesolexchange.com/nasa-will-pay-you-18000-to-stay-in-bed-and-smoke-weed-for-70-straight-days/,http://thesolexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-02-at-12.37.32-AM.png,['Mr

Fake_85-Webpage,"COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY","HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & It’s NOT PRETTY … FOR THEM

“The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.” – Thomas Jefferson

ELDER PATRIOT – Corrupt politicians ignore Jefferson’s directive to their own detriment. It’s no longer political, it’s personal.

Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.

Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.

Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trump’s America First agenda and said, “If we’re given the White House and both houses of Congress and we don’t deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.”

Candidate Trump promised many things – border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and – to the extent possible – an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?

After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans – notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham – have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.

So, what gives?

Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump’s promise to “Drain the Swamp.”

As we reported yesterday, “An F.B.I. agent with ‘intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case’ told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.”

The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn’t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.

Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.

One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation’s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.

Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children’s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren’t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.

Donald Trump’s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.

These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump’s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.

No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.

So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It’s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.

And, now that they’ve been caught robbing the world’s largest bank – the U.S. treasury – they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.

Washington’s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It’s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.

EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.

HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP

“Impeach!” It’s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word – long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama’s administration – but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it’s back with a vengeance.

Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the “I” word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked “Watergate.”

Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.

Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left’s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America’s new Richard Nixon.

“Watergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,” says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. “Now, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I’m not going to stop asking them.”

Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.

The posters read: “If you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans’ tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. … Resign now.”

But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned “impeachment” enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?

At this time, there’s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.

“The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,” Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:

For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.

However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless “gotcha” announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.

A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the “due administration of justice.”

However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence “corruptly” when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term “corruptly” is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted “with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.” Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.

Fake_86-Webpage,"Obama Canceled It, Trump Reinstated It – A Very Sacred Day is Back -","According to guerilla:

Obama Canceled It, Trump Reinstated It – A Very Sacred Day is Back.

Obama didn’t want to offend anyone, so our country’s heroes were shut out. not anymore.

President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with.

Trump told the crowd:

“Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time.”

Obama’s spokesman said the day of remembrance was scrapped so the Black Lives Matter movement wouldn’t be offended. Apparently it’s more important for the friends and families of criminals killed for not obeying simple commands to be coddled than it is for the families and friends of the brave men and women who run into harm’s way to save the innocent to be honored.

President Trump has righted that wrong once and for all. If the Black Lives Matter movement wants to remember their dead they can go ahead and burn down their neighborhoods. The families of fallen police will join together in laughter, grief and prayer remembering those they lost.

Fake_87-Webpage,Trump Gives Chaffetz The Thumbs Up For Investigating Hillary Clinton's Email Server,"President Donald Trump has finally given Congress the authorization to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.

Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.

Here is what Chaffetz said:

“President Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Here’s what he said: ‘You do a great job. Listen, I understand I’m the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Don’t slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.’ If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of ‘don’t slow down,’ I think was a good message.”

WATCH:

The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clinton’s email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasn’t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.

Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. It’s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she won’t make it out of this investigation so easily.

Fake_88-Webpage,“Rape Victims Should Be In Custody If There Is Suspicion That They’re Planning Abortion”,"At a campaign town hall event at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with “radical” positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.

“I don’t know what you’re talking – I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That’s what I believe,” declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. “I believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that’s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,” Rubio asserted.



Taking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would “put rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.”

“I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it,” Rubio said. “I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on.”

He added: “That is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.”

Asked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: “Don’t know yet, first thing’s first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.”/SOURCE

Fake_89-Webpage,Monica Lewinsky Found Dead In Roslindale – Freedum Junkshun,"Monica Lewinsky was having a visit with a friend from high school this week that ended in tragedy. Just moments ago, Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh confirmed that The coroner just left the scene where Monica Lewinsky, who we now know never ended her affair with Clinton, was found murdered in a burglary.

Police Chief Randall Getty told Leweigh:

“Pretty cut and dry. We have a suspect we think we have on several area cameras who is a known pot addict. He’s been in and out of jail more than a dozen times for possession. We’re looking at him and we’re also considering because of the high-profile nature of the case other suspects like the Clintons.”

When Louis asked him if the feds would take over he said that every protocol has changed for the past few months but he’s fairly certain anything that has to do with anyone named Clinton will be on the Justice Department’s radar. In this case, to not investigate would be silly.

Chief Getty felt pretty strongly that his pothead was the culprit. He may have seen or heard something that can’t be released yet. If that turns out to be true, the feds need to investigate this pot addict and find out just how much he was paid to be a patsy.

The cause of death is still unknown.

Fake_9-Webpage,Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because “Santa Was Always White In The Bible”,"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.

Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.”

“That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?”

“Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,” she concluded.",http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/,http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430.jpg,['Lea Vat Kens'],http://politicono.com,{'$date': 1480789769000},[],"['http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dakota_Meyer_with_President_Obama-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/thousands_protest_against_anti_gay_Charles-Worley-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/school.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430-645x325.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/130729170454-lead-intv-ted-cruz-full-00060416-story-top-150x150.jpg', 'http://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4mpm&p_id=Twitter', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sarah-palin-reality-show-150x150.jpg', 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/eric-trump-150x150.jpg']",http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/,"{'description': 'satire, satire article, satire news, satire palin, satire politics, satirical news', 'generator': 'WordPress 4.8', 'og': {'site_name': 'Newslo', 'description': '“Next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights”', 'title': 'Sarah Palin Calls To Boycott Mall Of America Because “Santa Was Always White In The Bible”', 'locale': 'en_US', 'image': 'http://politicono.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Black-Santa-Clause-Star-Tribune-800x430-150x150.jpg', 'updated_time': '2016-12-03T18:33:59+00:00', 'url': 'http://politicono.com/palin-calls-boycott-mall-america-santa-always-white-bible/', 'type': 'article'}, 'fb': {'app_id': 395152810558131}, 'article': {'publisher': 'http://facebook.com/Newslo1', 'section': 'Featured', 'published_time': '2016-12-03T18:29:29+00:00', 'modified_time': '2016-12-03T18:33:59+00:00'}, 'verifyownership': 'b03b12e9fdf4f032d48fc78bfadcdc32', 'viewport': 'width=device-width; initial-scale=1'}"

Fake_91-Webpage,Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas,"Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas:

Edward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIA’s payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.

In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.

All of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.

He currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” Snowden claims. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”

Snowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.

“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” Snowden claims. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”

NaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.

Despite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015.

Whilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was:

“I don’t want to live in a society that does these sort of things… I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.”

Fake_92-Webpage,Keanu Reeves Shock The World With Another Powerful Message,"Other than acting, Keanu’s wisdom towards life and in the present times really gives a real lesson for all of us.

“I cannot be part of a world where men dress their wives as prostitutes by showing everything that should be cherished. Where there is no concept of honor and dignity, and one can only rely on those when they say “I promise” .

Where women do not want children, and men don’t want a family.

Where the suckers believe themselves to be successful behind the wheel of their fathers` cars, and a father who has a little bit of power is trying to prove to you that you’re a nobody.

Where people falsely declare that they believe in God with a shot of alcohol in their hand, and the lack of any understanding of their religion.

Where the concept of jealousy is considered shameful, and modesty is a disadvantage.

Where people forgot about love, but are simply looking for the best partner.

Where people repair every rustle of their car, not sparing any money or time, and themselves, they look so poor that only an expensive car can hide it.

Where the boys waste their parents money in nightclubs, aping under the primitive sounds, and girls fall in love with them for this.

Where men and women are no longer identifiable and where all this together is called freedom of choice, but for those who choose a different path-get branded as retarded despots.

I choose my path, but it’s a pity that I did not find similar understanding in the people among whom I wished to find it most of all … “ – Keanu Reeves

Fake_93-Webpage,The DEA Just Raided A United States Senator–Dems In A Panic – News Feed Hunter,"The DEA just raided the vacation ranch of Democrat Senator Hal Lindsay (D-NJ), seizing more than 400 marijuana plants, 2 greenhouses full of opium-producing poppies and a small lab that was pumping out massive amounts of refined, finished product. The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.

The bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. All in all, Senator Lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. He was taken into custody at his office in Washington DC and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail.

Lindsay’s office isn’t commenting on the ordeal but New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible. The loss of yet another seat, especially in the northeast, would be devastating to the Democrats.

Fake_94-Webpage,NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 15 Days Of Darkness In November 2017,"There have been many reports about the changes our planet Earth could endure in the months and years to come but many of them didn’t really pan out, making us question everything we read on the internet. But this time, NASA confirms what’s been circling the web recently – our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29.

NASA reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didn’t know exactly when. Upon more detailed examination the astronomers from NASA confirmed that the phenomenon will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.
images (4).jpg
According to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between Jupiter and Venus. There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.
According to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus’ bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.
Once the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.

As a result of this strange phenomenon, the Sun’s light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.

“We do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event. The only effect this event will have on Earth is an increase of 6 – 8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. No one should worry much. This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter”, Bolden said.",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]

Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”

Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.

Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.

On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.

While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.

Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.

Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.

Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.

Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!

Fake_96-Webpage,"Liberal Women Hate Me Because Of My ""Striking Beauty And Intellect"", Says Kellyanne Conway","Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump claimed that Liberal women hate her because of her “striking beauty and intellect” in comments that were made to a reporter at a luncheon in Washington D.C.

Pundits were quick to capitalise on her comments and tell her that if she and her boss were doing a good job and being open and honest with the American people then she wouldn’t have to face much criticism.

“Making ridiculous claims that she’s being hated because of her good looks is as ridiculous as it gets. The American people don’t care if she looks like a model or not. All they want is to see her doing a good job and not spinning facts around,” wrote James Collin, a New York based attorney and registered Democrat.

Kellyanne Conway’s comments have caused reactions on social media especially on Twitter where she has been blasted as “a show off and trying to divert attention from the most important issues facing our country.”

Fake_97-Webpage,Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression,"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.

According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.

Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.

Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.

When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.

The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.

According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.

William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:

“I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.

Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.

Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.

In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.

Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.

Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.

“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”

Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.

As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.

All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.",http://themiamigazette.com/cannibals-arrested-florida-claim-eating-human-flesh-cures-diabetes-depression/,http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png,['Anthony Brooks'],http://themiamigazette.com,{'$date': 1496151793000},[],"['http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Basement-Fridge.png', 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Basement.png', 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Police-Spokesman.png', 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Home.png', 'http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/297522ab22952144f7a0e9e8f1d75843?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibal-Tools.png', 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png']",http://themiamigazette.com/cannibals-arrested-florida-claim-eating-human-flesh-cures-diabetes-depression/,"{'description': 'Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'author': 'Anthony Brooks', 'og': {'site_name': 'The Miami Gazette', 'description': 'Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.', 'title': 'Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression', 'locale': 'en_US', 'image': {'width': 956, 'identifier': 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png', 'height': 632}, 'updated_time': '2017-05-30T13:44:24+00:00', 'url': 'http://themiamigazette.com/cannibals-arrested-florida-claim-eating-human-flesh-cures-diabetes-depression/', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'image': 'http://themiamigazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannibals.png', 'description': 'Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.', 'card': 'summary', 'title': 'Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression'}, 'article': {'section': 'Uncategorized', 'tag': 'Vernal Heights', 'published_time': '2017-05-30T13:43:13+00:00', 'modified_time': '2017-05-30T13:44:24+00:00'}}"
Fake_98-Webpage,Libtard Hero Al Franken Forced To Resign In Disgrace,"Libtard Democrat Al Franken will resign his seat as US Senator and Minority Leader this morning after learning that the White House has enough on him to ruin his marriage and send him to jail. Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy.

This was a great move by Trump. Not only does he get rid of a huge political opponent, he shows America that our elected officials can be compromised and forced to do as they’re told. No more of this pussyfooting around with majority votes and filibusters…either get in line of get out.

One of these days the Democrats will realize they can’t keep up with the winning strategy of the Republican party. It doesn’t matter how many more votes the Dems get, the GOP continues to grow stronger. With Schumer out of the way it will grow even stronger. The alleged file on Franken includes things like pushing entitlement programs that are meant to give away free stuff for votes and adultery.

President Trump doesn’t mess around.

Fake_99-Webpage,Chinese Lunar Rover Finds No Evidence Of American Moon Landings!,"Chinese Lunar Rover Finds No Evidence Of American Moon Landings!:

A new scandal has happened after high ranking officials from the Chinese space program called the American moon landing “a complete hoax”, the Beijing Daily Express reports.

The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldn’t find any proof of American landings on the Moon.

The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that there’s no trace of these moon landings.

Now the Chinese space program has launched a petition, already signed by 200 of its high-ranking officials, demanding explanation from the US government and the release of classified NASA information which will finally put an end to all the speculations and give definitive proof of the American moon landings.

Or maybe it was just an elaborate hoax with the sole purpose to fool the world about its space program capabilities. Whatever the case they need to come forward and speak the truth.

The petition has been signed by world-renowned nuclear engineer, Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin, and numbers of other prominent Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents.

They’re all saying that the Russian government “has always been aware of the situation since the early 1970s”.

The claims are favored by conspiracy theorists who have tried to convince the public for decades that the USA hasn’t ever landed on the Moon.

The landing was just an elaborate plan to trick Russia into believing they are further ahead in the space race.
